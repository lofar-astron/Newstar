## The Netherlands East West Synthesis Telescope Array Reduction

Newstar is the software package to reduce data from the WSRT, the Westerbork Synthese Radio Telescope. 

The WSRT is operated by the Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy (the NFRA), now ASTRON.

Newstar was mainly written by Wim Brouw. Newstar is not being actively developed anymore.

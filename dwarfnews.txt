 911210	Some improvements have been made to DWARF.
	The main improvement is that a program is starting faster because
	the symbol handling software is much faster. The number of symbols
	allowed is unlimited, but of course you should not let it grow too
	much. The symbol files are now located in a separate subdirectory,
	which is automatically created by .dwarflogin when it does not exist.
	.dwarflogout saves your symbol files and deletes symbol files older
	than 1 week.  You should therefore use
		source $SYSDWARF/.dwarflogout    in your logout file.
	Secondly the EXEC call is used as much as possible to start the
	programs. This has the benefit that no shell is created to run the
	program and that EXECUTE disappears after having started the program.
	Thirdly some environment variables resembling the VAX logical names
	have been defined. These are $SYSDWARF, $RUNDWARF and $LIBDWARF.
	These variables should be used as much as possible instead of the
	~dwarf construction, because they are more system independent.
	At last a few minor bugs have been removed.

 910913	The following DWARF command aliases have been defined:
	dwc	for dwclear (see 910814)
	dwe	for dwexe (see below)
	dwl	for dwlet (see 910814)
	dwn	for dwnews (display this file)
	dwr	for restore (see 910814)
	dws	for specify
	dwsa	for dwsave (see 910814)
	dwv	for dwview (see 910817)

	The DWARF command dwexe has been installed. It behaves roughly like
	the EXE*CUTE command on the VAX, e.g.:
	dwexe 'program$stream <qualifiers>'
		runs the program in the given stream taking the qualifiers
		into account.
	The following qualifiers are recognized:
	/[no]ask /[no]save /[no]test	(as on the VAX);
	/input=<file>		lets the program read input from the file;
	/nowait			runs the program in the background (it will
				stop when it needs input from the terminal);
	/batch			runs the program in the background, but lets
				the program take its input from the null device
				and writes the output to <prognam><stream>.log;
	/debug			executes the program under dbx;
	/norun			for N-type programs: runs the program in
				specify mode: only asks for parameter input
				and saves the answers in external defaults);
				for other programs: only saves any ask, save
				or test switch given (as on the VAX);
	/nolog or /log=<value>
	/nodatab
	/noinfix
	/noapply or /apply=<list>
	/node_apply or /de_apply=<list>
				are only recognized for N-type programs; first,
				defaults for the corresponding program
				parameters are specified according to the
				qualifiers 	given.

 910817	Command dwview installed (similar to DWARF/VAX's VIEW):
	Examples:
	dwview
		lists all external defaults (specified or restored)
	dwview 'program$stream'
		lists all program parameters and their current defaults
		(external or PPD) in the given or current stream
	dwview 'program /external'
		only lists the program parameters with external defaults
	dwview 'name_list /input=save_file'
		lists all saved parameter defaults matching the namelist

 910814	Some more VAX/DWARF commands have been activated on the Alliant.
	The command lines given below are meant to show all the possible
	qualifiers; all their names can be abbreviated to a single letter.
	The quotes suppress the interpretation of meta-characters by the shell.

	dwclear 'list /exclude=list /confirm /log=long'
		clears the listed parameter defaults (list required)
	dwsave 'list /output=file /exclude=list /confirm /log=short'
		saves the listed defaults in the file
		(default: save all defaults in .dwarfsave.sav)
	restore 'file /include=list /exclude=list /confirm /overwrite /nolog'
		restores (all) defaults from the file
	dwlet 'name=value /log=short'
		defines a global symbol
	prtunits
		displays DWARF units and conversion factors

 910806	External defaults are no longer automatically carried over from your
	previous session. However, you can activate this option by copying
	~dwarf/protologout to ~/.logout. From then on, when you log out, all
	the defaults are saved in the file ~/symbol.sav and, when you log in
	again, DWARF's login procedure will restore them.

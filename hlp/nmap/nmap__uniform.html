<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> NATURAL, STANDARD, FULL Measure function for UV coverage
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(8).<P>
Specify the way the UV coverage should be determined: <P>
	STANDARD: Weigh each observed point with the track length it covers in 
		   the UV plane, and average sets of redundant baselines. This 
		   method accounts properly for the fact that the density of 
		   measured points is inversely proportional to the baseline,  
		   for the multiplicity of redundant baselines and for 
		   variations in integration times. <P>
	FULL:     Weigh each point according to the actual UV point density. In 
		   this case care is also taken of all local UV plane density 
		   enhancements, e.g. because there is overlap between 
		   observations. <P>
	NATURAL:  Take each individual measured point separately, without 
		   weighing for the UV track covered by it. This option gives 
		   the maximum possible signal/noise ratio in your map, but it 
		   generally weighs the short baselines much too heavily which 
		   results in a very fat synthesized beam. <P>
Of these options, FULL gives the cleanest synthesized beam, but it is slower 
because it necessitates an extra read pass over the .SCN-file data. <P>

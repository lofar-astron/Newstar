 <b>MONGO graphics</b>
<P>
In many cases, the user will need the results of <i>NEWSTAR </i> processing in graphical form. In order to make this easier, the output of programs like NGCALC can be specified to be in `MONGO' format. These are ASCII files, organised in columns, which can be processed by the MONGO graphics program. Because it is ASCII, the knowledgeable user can easily edit the file with a standard editor, to fine-tune the  resulting representation.
<P>
MONGO &#169;is an interactive graphics program, written by John L. Tonry. 
For a detailed description, see the MONGO manual. In this section, a few simple examples are given to give the user the general idea, and to get him/her over the initial barrier.
<P>
In Dwingeloo, MONGO is only available on the VAX. Create the MONGO command by typing 
<BR>tex2html_html_special_mark_ampMONGO :== @user5:[mongo]mongo.com&amp;
<P>
MONGO can be used interactively, or by means of a command ``macro'' (.MAC). The data usually reside in an ASCII data file, which may be edited by the user.

<A NAME=.simple.plot><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="../icons/invis_anchor.png"></A> 
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0000100000000000000> <b>A simple MONGO plot</b></A></H2>
<P>
Create a MONGO data file (extension .DAT). This is an ASCII, in which the data is lined up in columns. In this case, replace the string &quot;.....&quot; in the first column with 0,1,2,3 etc to indicate channel nr.
<P>
Then make a MONGO command macro (ext .MAC):

<P>
Alternative: use MONGO interactively.

<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Type of Selfcal desired SELFCAL, ALIGN
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(8).<P>
Selfcal is the generic name for all methods that use a source model in 
combination with your visibilities to estimate the telecope gain/phase 
corrections. Since you have selected a model, NCALIB assumes that you want to 
use it, by doing a Selfcal. (If you had not, it would propose a REDUNdancy-only 
solution.) <P>
The alternative you have here is to use the source model to recover the unknown 
position shift that scans suffer when they are processed with the  redundancy 
constraints only (REDUN solution). In this operation the source model is only 
used as a position reference. The telescope phases are shifted by an amount 
that is a linear function of position along the array; the telescope gains do 
not change at all. <P>
To summarise, the choices you have are: <P>
   SELFCAL       use the model to constrain in position a redundancy solution 
                  that will be made now 
   ALIGN         use the model to constrain a redundancy solution that was made 
                  earlier  <P>

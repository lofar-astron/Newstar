<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Increments to telescope X positions (mm) |
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Real number, 14 values.<P>
Specify the X telescope corrections in mm, one value per telescope. <P>
The correction will be added as an HA-dependent phase to the OTH telescope 
corrections. It can only be undone by either zeroing the entire OTH corrections 
by means of the SET ZERO option (which will destroy whatever other corrections 
have been stored there), or by inserting the same BASEL_DX value with opposite 
sign. <P>
The default value 0, 0, ...0, 0 leaves the corrections unchanged. <P>

<H1>Program NCALIB: private keyword BASEL_POLE</H1> 

<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> "Increment to baseline-pole declination correction (deg) |"
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Real number, 1 values.<P>
Specify the baseline-pole declination correction in degrees. <P>
The correction will be added as an HA-dependent phase to the OTH telescope 
corrections. It can only be undone by either zeroing the entire OTH corrections 
by means of the SET ZERO option (which will destroy whatever other corrections 
have been stored there), or by inserting the same BASEL_POLE value with 
opposite sign.. <P>
The default value 0 leaves the corrections unchanged. <P>

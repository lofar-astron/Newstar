<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Weight for points flagged with WGT flag
<DT><EM>Default:</EM> 1.
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Real number.<P>
The WGT flag directs NCALIB to multiply the data weight with an additional 
weighing factor. <P>
You may use this feature to reduce the weight of data affected by interference 
without rejecting it completely. The effect of this in a Selfcal solution is 
that it prevents the interference from bad interferometers to infect the 
healthy ones. <P>
A value of 1 will give all interferometers the weight they have in the .SCN 
file.  <P>

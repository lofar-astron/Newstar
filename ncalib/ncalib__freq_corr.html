<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Increment to frequency correction (MHz)
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Real number, 1 values.<P>
Specify the 'frequency correction' in MHz. <P>
This is an idiosyncratic way of representing a correction to the metric scale 
of the interferometer array: A scale correction with a factor (1+x) is 
represented by correcting the nominal observing frequency F with an additive 
term -x.F. <P>
Clearly this does not represent a real frequency shift since the observing 
frequency is precisely defined by the settings of local-oscillator frequencies 
and fringe-stopping parameters during the observation. <P>
The correction will be ADDED as an hour-angle-dependent phase to the OTH 
telescope corrections, and can only be undone by either zeroing these 
corrections, or inserting the same BASEL_POLE value with opposite sign.  <P>

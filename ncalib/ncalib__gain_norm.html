<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Gain reference telescopes
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Integer number, 14 values.<P>
Define the telescopes to be used as reference for renormalising the telescope 
gains. <P>
Your reply should be an array of values (separated by commas) for telescopes 0 
through D; 1 means that you select the telescope, 0 that you don't. Trailing 0s 
may be omitted. <P>
A wildcard ('*') means 'all', i.e. 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 <P>
Example: 
        0, 1, 0, 1, 0 means 'use telescopes 1 and 3 as reference' <P>
NOTES: <P>
Renormalisation adjusts the gains so that the average for the fixed telescopes 
selected equals that for the moving telescopes. If either group is absent from 
yous selection, the average gain of the other group is made 0. <P>
Consequently, proper gain renormalisation is possible only for the 'standard' 
WSRT configuration: If there are any fixed-fixed or movable-movable 
interferometers, a message will be given and the operation aborted. <P>
You may, however, insist by putting a -1 instead of any of the 1s in your 
reply. The renormalisation will then be performed as if the fixed-movable 
interferometers were absent, and a warning given that the gain corrections for 
those interferometers are jeopardized.

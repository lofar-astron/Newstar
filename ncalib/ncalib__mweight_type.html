<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(10).<P>
MWEIGHT_TYPE and MWEIGHT_DATA allow you to weigh baselines according to their 
lengths, in order to take advantage of source characteristics that are a priori 
known. The defaults for these parameters give all baselines the same weight. <P>
This parameter selects the form of the weighting function; its position and 
half-width will be defined by MWEIGHT_DATA. The following shapes can be chosen: <P>
   STEP          a step function: 1 out to some radius, 0 beyond 
   GAUSSIAN      a Gaussian 
   TRIANGLE      a triangular function: linearly decreasing from 1 to 0 <P>
   Each of these can be prefixed with an 'I' to invert it, i.e. ISTEP means 
    '1 minus STEP'  <P>

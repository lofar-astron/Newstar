Specify action to perform to alter correction values. <P>
   Note: POLARISATION corrections are NOT included here. They must be handled 
    sparately through the POLAR main option. <P>
These option write correction values in (a) set(s) of target sectors (selected 
by the SCN_&lt;xxx&gt; parameters). These corrections are copied/calulated from 
corrections /data in the same file or another one (USE_SCN_&lt;xxx&gt; parameters). 
The calculations will use all source sectors you specify to obtain a single set 
of corrections. Unless stated otherwise below, the new values will be ADDED to 
the existing ones in each of the target sectors. <P>
   Transfer of corrections from a reference source: <P>
        COPY    copy all corrections from somewhere else 
                 (all corrections in the input set(s) are averaged) 
        CCOPY   copy corrections from surrounding (in time) observations 
                 in the input sets with the same frequency channel 
                 (corrections for the two input sets are averaged). 
        ICOPY   copy all MIFR corrections from somewhere else 
                 (all corrections in the input set(s) are averaged) 
        LINE    copy all corrections from corresponding continuum channel <P>
   Initialisation: <P>
        ZERO    zero corrections 
        MANUAL  copy input values into the OTH telescope corrections for 
                 selected scans 
        INIT    make an initial estimate of telescope corrections and shift the 
                 present values accordingly 
        RENORM  renormalise telescope corrections <P>
   Manual-input actions. Each option represents a correction type for which 
   your values will be requested. <P>

<DT>   - For the following actions, your values will OVERWRITE the existing ones: <P>
        EXT     set extinction in selected scans 
        REF     set refraction in selected scans 
        IREF    set ionospheric refraction in selected scans 
        FAR     set Faraday rotation in selected scans 
        IFR     set additive interferometer corrections in selected scans 
        MIFR    set multiplicative interferometer corrections in selected scans 
        CLK     set clock correction in selected scans 
        SHIFT   set (de-apply!) coordinate shift in selected sectors <P>
        QUIT    exit SET  <P>

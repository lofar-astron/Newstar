This branch of NCALIB implements methods to define the unknown X-Y phase-zero 
difference ('PZD') in the parallel-dipole configuration. <P>
Correction values may be saved in an arbitrary selection of target sectors,  
selected by the SCN_&lt;xxx&gt; parameters. The new corrections are OTH telescope 
phases which will be ADDED to any existing ones in each of the sectors you 
specify for output. <P>
In determining the corrections, the program uses a collection of input sectors,  
which may coincide with the target sectors or be selected by the USE_SCN_ 
parameters (for the COPY option). It is assumed that the source for these is a 
calibrator with significant Stokes U and 'negligibly' small Stokes V. If this 
condition is not fulfilled, the result will be meaningless. <P>
The PZD is a phase value that is ADDED to the existing OTH phase correction of 
the X channels. For this reason, you must be cautious to <P>

<DT>        - avoid more than one COPY to the same target data and 

<DT>        - avoid ruining a calibrator observation by doing an APPLY on it. (If 
           you should do this by accident, use MANUAL to restore the observation 
           to its previous state.) <P>
Specify action to perform: <P>
   Actions recommended for routine use: <P>
        CALC    calculate PZD from the selected node and sectors (SCN_ 
                 parameters) and display it with its mean error. Use this option 
                 to check if a calibrator observation is suitable for 
                 determining the PZD. <P>
        COPY    as APPLY, but use X-Y phase-difference value derived from 
                 a calibrator observation (USE_SCN_&lt;xxx&gt; parameters). Use this 
                 option to set the correction for your observations <P>
        MANUAL  manually input phase-difference value <P>
   Other actions: <P>
        SCAN    as CALC, but per individual scan <P>
        APPLY   as CALC, then apply the correction to the sectors selected 
                 (SCN_&lt;xxx&gt; parameters). 
                NOTE that once you have performed this operation, a CALC or COPY 
                 operation on the same input data will yield PZD=0, so these 
                 data can no longer be used to calibrate another observation. <P>
        ASK     as APPLY, but display and ask for confirmation before modifying 
                 the existing values <P>
        QUIT    exit from VZERO  <P>

<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Correct antenna pattern for mapping taper: YES/NO
<DT><EM>Default:</EM> NO /NOASK.
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Logical.<P>
The gridding convolution in map-making is usually compensated for by 
multiplying the output map and antenna pattern with a taper function that rises 
toward the map edges. <P>
If this is the case, answering YES here will instruct the program to account 
for this effect; this will reduce the aliasing errors in the residual map,  
allowing you to clean a somewhat larger part of the map. YES will in general 
produce a result with less aliasing, NO the reverse. <P>

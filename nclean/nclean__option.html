CLEANing: <P>
   BEAM         Hogbom clean: Use the map and the beam to clean. This 
                 method is inaccurate away from the map centre due to the 
                 aliasing associated with visibility gridding. <P>
   UVCOVER      Standard Clark Clean: Find and provisionally subtract sources 
                 in some map areas first (minor cycles), then properly subtract 
                 the sources found (major cycle). The number of minor cycles 
                 between major cycles is determined by the program; the user can 
                 steer this through a few control parameters. 
                The method suffers from the same limitations as BEAM, but is 
                 faster for cleaning extended sources. <P>
   DATA         Cotton-Schwab Clean: Find sources as in UVCOVER, but perform 
                 the major cycle on the original SCN-file visibilities, making a 
                 new map from the residuals as input for the next major cycle. 
                 This method rigorously avoids the aliasing limitations of BEAM 
                 and UVCOVER, at the price of being very much slower. <P>
   UREST        Use a clean component list and a map to restore the clean 
                 components in the map. <P>
For exploring the data before committing more serious work: <P>
   HISTO        Produce only a histogram of selected areas in the map and/or 
                 antenna pattern <P>
   COMPON       Execute minor cycles as for UVCOVER, but omit the following 
                 major cycle. The result is a source model and a map in which 
                 these sources are provisionally subtracted in selected areas. 
                It is the fastest of the four CLEAN variants but produces an 
                 inaccurate residual map. 
                This option may be used to quickly get a feel for the 
                 minor-cycle control of UVCOVER and DATA Clean, or to make an 
                 initial data model for NCALIB SELFCAL or NMODEL UPDATE. <P>
Other options: <P>
   QUIT          Terminate NCLEAN. <P>

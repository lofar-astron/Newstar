<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> residual map?
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Logical.<P>
Specify if the residual map must be written. <P>
For BEAM and UVCOVER cleaning, this map is an automatic by-product of the 
process and the choice is whether or not to write it to the .WMP file. The map 
will be given the same indices as the input map except for an incremented 
sequence number. <P>
For UVDAT cleaning, the residual map must be constructed by making a new map 
from the original visibilities, in which the CLEAN components just found are 
subtracted. The new map will OVERWRITE the input map. <P>

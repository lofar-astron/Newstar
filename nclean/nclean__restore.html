<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> restored map (YES/NO)?
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Logical.<P>
Specify if a restored map must be written. <P>
A restored map consists of the CLEAN components convolved with a hypothetical 
beam that has no sidelobes, superimposed on the residuals. It is an 
approximation to  what you would have observed with complete contiguous UV 
coverage (hoth in hour angle and baseline) up to the longest baseline available. <P>
You will be given the option to suppress the residuals (parameter MAP_FACTOR),  
in which case you get a map of the CLEAN components only. <P>

        NCOPY is a program to selectively copy data from an input to an output SCN file. Its basic use is to condense SCN files by 
<UL><LI>   selecting only those sectors, scans and polarisations that one wants to retain; 
<LI>   eliminating &quot;holes&quot; in a file that are no longer used. 
</UL> As an ancillary function, NCOPY can produce overviews of all sectors in a SCN file.

<UL><LI>   OVERVIEW: Produce on terminal and in the log file a listing of all sectors in a file. In addition to the layout (as for NFLAG SHOW) and file size, the following is shown for each sector: 
                <i>g.o.f.c.s</i> and absolute sector numbers; 
                field name and WSRT observation number; 
                frequency and bandwidth; 
                hour-range and number of scans; 
                numbers of interferometers and polarisations; 
                technical information for testing/debugging purposes (subject to change).
<P>
The information relevant to the user is crammed into the width of a terminal window.
<P>
<LI>   COPY: Copy sectors. The following additional information is requested once for every time the COPY option is selected:
<P>
INPUT_SCAN<BR>OUTPUT_SCAN<BR>INPUT_SECTORS<BR>HA_RANGE<BR>POLARISATION <BR>Data will be appended to the output file. If the latter does not exist, a new file is created and its creation reported.
<P>
        A new output group is created for every input group, the remaining indices, o.f.c.s, being taken from the input. 
</UL>

<P>
        As future options, to be realised only upon user demand, we consider: 
<UL><LI>   integration of data over hour-angle intervals; 
<LI>   selection of interferometers; 
<LI>   definition of output sector numbers by the user and (partial) correction of the deficiencies noted above;
<P>
<LI>   permanent application of corrections to the stored data as foreseen in the original Newstar design.

<H1>Program NFLAG: private keyword DRY_SCANS</H1> 

<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Number of scans to use in trial runs
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Integer number; min.value: 1.000000.<P>
'Clipping' operations need (a) threshold value(s) that is (are) related to the 
magnitude of the data at hand. <P>
The program determines a 'rasonable' default for such cases by performing a 
'trial run' on the first of the scans in the data cube selected. You may 
specify their number here. The trial run evaluates the clipping criterion but 
does NOT modify the .SCN file.  For data with reasonably stationary statistics,  
the default number should be adequate. A larger number obviously will take more 
time to process. If you specify a very large number, the trial run will include 
the entire data cube selected.  <P>

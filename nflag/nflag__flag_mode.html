 You may select one of the options at a time. 
 The logical ones, such as CORR/NOCORR will take effect immediately. For the 
others, you will be prompted for (a) new value(s).  The values shown below as 
defaults are the ones with which NFLAG starts up. <P>
   Redefinition of the primary data cube: <P>
        HYPER:    Change the primary data cube by selecting new polarisation,  
                   interferometer and hour-angle ranges. 
        SECTORS:  As HYPER but including a change of the SCN_SECTORS selection. 
        NODE:     Completely new primary data cube (i.e. including new .SCN 
                   file) <P>
   Data-correction modes. Shown in parentheses is NFLAG's initial setting: <P>
        CORR/NOCORR (=NOCORR): 
                Reading mode for visibility data: without/with corrections 
                 applied and ignoring/acknowledging flags. 
                 (NOCORR mode will be ignored in those cases for which the use 
                 of uncorrected data would be pointless, e.g. ARESID, RRESID). <P>
        UFLAG (=ALL): 
                Default flag types to be acknowledged when reading data in 
                 CORR mode. <P>
   Run modes: <P>
        SHOW/NOSHOW (=SHOW): 
                After each flagging operation, show/don't show a summary of the 
                 new flag settings for the data cube and flag types selected 
for 
                 that operation. 
                Note that in either mode the affected flags will be counted 
                 anyway, so you can use INSPECT afterwards to show summatries 
                 from various perspectives <P>
        DRYRUN/NODRYRUN (=DRYRUN): 
                For any operation that would change flags in the .SCN file,  
                 do/don't do a 'trial run' first, - e.g. to get a feeling for 
                 sensible default values for clip limits etc. 
                 (For NODRYRUN safe default values will be chosen for such 
                 limits so that nothing will happen until the user sets his own 
                 values.) <P>
        NOTRACE/TRACE (=NOTRACE): 
                Dont't/do trace the flagging operations through messages on the 
                 terminal. TRACE is likely to produce a lot of output and 
                 intended for debugging purposes only. <P>
   Navigation: <P>
        QUIT:    Go back to FLAG_OPTION. <P>

 Remember that only the primary data cube is affected. <P>
The following operations flag individual data points, according to a flagging 
criterion that is derived from the visibilities themselves. You will be 
prompted for an upper limit. For each visibility point exceeding the limit the 
flag will be set if it exceeds the limit, for the others it will be cleared: 
Current flags are NOT preserved. <P>
The flag type is CLIP, unless you have defined your own type through the 
USER_FLAGS parameter. <P>
   Flagging on straight data values exceeding the threshold. These criteria are 
   intended for use with CORRECTED data (Parameter FLAG_MODE=CORR). <P>
        AMPL    Threshold applies to absolute value 
        COS     Threshold applies to real (cosine) part. 
        SIN     Threshold applies to imaginary (sine) part. <P>
   Flagging on Selfcal/Redundancy residuals. You will be prompted to specify 
the 
   Selfcal source model used in the latest NCALIB SEFCAL/REDUN run. 
   (NOTE that the residuals here are VECTOR differences between observation 
    and source model; this definition is different from that used by NPLOT.) <P>
        ARESID  Threshold applies to the magnitude of the residual 
        RRESID  Threshold is the absolute difference of the residual's 
magnitude 
                 from the average magnitude of all residuals in the scan for 
the 
                 same baseline. (In short: This flags outliers in sets of 
                 redundant baselines.) 
                NOTE: This operation can be performed even on uncalibrated 
data,  
                 provided a source model is available. <P>
   Flagging on polarisation-related criteria: <P>
        QXY     Threshold applies to the magnitude of the difference between XX 
                 and YY visibilities per interferometer (i.e. magnitude of 
                 Stokes Q for parallel dipoles). 
        UXY     Threshold applies to ABS(XY-YX) per interferometer 
                 (i.e. ABS(U) if the dipoles are parallel). 
        VXY     Threshold applies to ABS(j(XY+YX)) per interferometer 
                 (i.e. ABS(V) if the dipoles are parallel). <P>
                For unpolarised sources, this criterion should be as effective 
                 as ARESID above. <P>
   Flagging on discontinuities in time. The flags raised here serve only as an 
   ALERT that there is a 'jump' in the data; you will have to decide yourself 
   what to do about the problem. <P>
        DT1     Threshold is the difference in amplitude of a data point with 
                 its counterpart in the preceding scan. <P>
  Navigation: <P>
        INSPECT Make detour into the (flag) INSPECTion section of the program 
        STATIST Make detour into the (data) STATISTics section of the program 
        MODE    Make detour into the environment MODE-control section of the 
                 program 
        CLEAR   Go to the CLEAR-flags operation. 
        QUIT    Return to FLAG_OPTION.  <P>

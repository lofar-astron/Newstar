 Remember that only the primary data cube is affected. <P>
   Flagging of data points on the basis of their coordinates. The flag type is 
   SHADOW, unless you have selected your own type (parameter FLAG_MODE). <P>
        SHAD      In each scan, flag all data that are affected by 'shadowing',  
                   i.e. all interferometers in which the aperture of either 
                   telecope is partly blocked by another telescope in the line 
                   of sight. <P>
        PBAS      Flag all data for which the length of the projected baseline 
                   is within a range (for which you will be prompted). This is 
a 
                   way to eliminate short baselines susceptible to 
interference,  
                   without losing more data than necessary. <P>
        ELEVATION Flag all uv-data that have been taken at elevations below a 
                   limit (for which you will be prompted). <P>
        REDUN     Flag all redundant baselines. 
        NONRED    Flag all non-redundant baselines. <P>
   Navigation: <P>
        INSPECT Make detour into the (flag) INSPECTion section of the program 
        STATIST Make detour into the (data) STATISTics section of the program 
        MODE    Make detour into the enviornment MODE-control section of the 
                 program 
        CLEAR   Go to the CLEAR-flags operation. 
        QUIT    Return to FLAG_OPTION.  <P>

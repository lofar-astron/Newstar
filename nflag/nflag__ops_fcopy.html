 FCOPY propagates flags of the selected type from individual 
interferometers to groups of interferometers that have something in common with 
the flagged ones. <P>
Flags are looked for in the entire primary data cube, but changes affect only 
the primary/secondary cube. Make sure that you understand which of the 8 flag 
types are affected! 
!!              Primary/secondary: Correct? <P>
   Operations that modify flags on individual data points: <P>
        TOTEL  Copy flags from interferometers to telescopes: For each scan 
                selected, flag all data that share a dipole (X or Y channel of 
                a telescope) with any interferometer for which the flag 
                selected is set. <P>
        TOPOL  Copy flags to all polarisations: For each scan selected, flag 
all 
                polarisations of all telescope pairs for which the flag 
selected 
                is already set for at least one of them. (This is a sort of 
                mini-PUT). 
!!                      Each scan &lt;--&gt; primary data cube? <P>
   Operations that affect ENTIRE scans. NOTE that these IGNORE ANY SELECTIONS 
   you have defined for interferometers (parameter IFRS) and/or polarisations 
   (parameter SELECT_XYX). 
!               {\em see the dictinction between\ 
!               \whichref{data and header flags}{} } <P>
        TOHEAD  For each flag selected, set the scan-header flag if it is set 
                 for more than a given number (paremeter TOH_LIMIT) of data 
                 points. 
                This invalidates the entire scan. The operation is reversible 
                 (parameter OPS_MANUAL = CLHEAD); the individual data flags 
                 are not affected. 
!                       {\em See parameters \textref{TOH_LIMIT}{.toh.limit},  
!                       \textref{OPS_MANUAL}{.ops.manual} } <P>
        TODATA  Transfer flags of the type selected from the header of each 
scan 
                 to all the scan's data, deleting them in the headers. <P>
   Navigation: <P>
        INSPECT Make detour into the (flag) INSPECTion section of the program 
        STATIST Make detour into the (data) STATISTics section of the program 
        MODE    Make detour into the enviornment MODE-control section of the 
                 program 
        CLEAR   Go to the CLEAR-flags operation. 
        QUIT    Return to FLAG_OPTION.  <P>

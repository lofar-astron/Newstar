 Specify operations on the internal flag list: The entries in 
this list represent flagging instructions. Each entry contains a flag type, and 
ranges for the secondary data cube (i.e. hour angle, polarisation,  
interferometer and channel ranges) to which it applies. <P>
   Flagging operations involving the internal flag list: <P>
        DELETE  Clear the entire list. <P>
        GET     Collect flags of specified type(s) from the specified primary 
                 data cube, translate them into flaqg-list entries and merge 
                 them into the list. 
                The default flag type is ALL, but it can be changed (parameter 
                 FLAG_MODE). 
!                       {\em see \whichref{paremeter FLAG_MODE}{} } 
!!                      correct? <P>
        PUT     Use he entries in the internal flag list to set flags for 
                 selected visibilities or scans. 
                If an entry in the list results in setting the flags on all 
data 
                 points in a scan, the corresponding scan-header flag is set 
                 instead for efficiency reasons. <P>
   Transfer of the flag list to/from an external file. Two types of file may be 
   used: <P>
      The .FLF file is in a compact binary format that is efficient in both 
      operating speed and disk-space. It is accessed through: 
        LOAD    Merge contents of a .FLF file into the internal flag list 
        UNLOAD  Write the internal flag list to a new .FLF file <P>
     The list can also be stored in an ASCII file which you can inspect and 
edit 
     as you please. ASCII files are bulky and take much more time to process. 
     They are accessed through: 
        READ    Merge contents of an ASCII flag-list file into the internal 
flag 
                 list 
        WRITE   Write the internal flag list to a new ASCII flag-list file <P>
   Inspection: <P>
        HEADER  Show the contents of the flag-list header. 
        LIST    Show the contents of the flag-list (can be long!). 
!!                       Implement control-C 
        LCOUNT  Count the flags in the flag list (NOT in the data!). 
                 These can be INSPECTed in various one-dimensional projections. <P>
   Navigation: <P>
        INSPECT Make detour into the (flag) INSPECTion section of the program 
        STATIST Make detour into the (data) STATISTics section of the program 
        MODE    Make detour into the environment MODE-control section of the 
                 program 
        CLEAR   Go to the CLEAR-flags operation. 
        QUIT    Go back to what you were doing before.  <P>

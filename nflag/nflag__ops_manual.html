 Specify one of the manual flagging operations. Remember that 
only the selected primary/secondary data cube is affected. Make sure that you 
understand which of the 8 flag types are affected.

   BEWARE! Much work can be undone with careless clearing! <P>
        CLEAR   Clear all flags of the specified type(s) in both the 
                 scan headers and the uv data of the selected cube. 
!!                      What if a scan "protrudes" outside the cube? 
        CLDAT   Clear flags on the visibilities only (i.e. leave scan headers 
                 alone). 
        CLHEAD  Clear flags in the scan headers only. <P>

                 visibilities, for selected interferometer(s) within the

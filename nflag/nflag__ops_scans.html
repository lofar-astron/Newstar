 The operations available here flag scan headers and thereby 
affect ENTIRE scans; in doing so they IGNORE ANY SELECTIONS you have defined 
for interferometers (parameter IFRS) and/or polarisations (parameter 
SELECT_XYX). Apart from this, only those scans that overlap with the primary 
data cube are affected. <P>
For each of the options an appropriate flag is selected, as noted below. If you 
have defined your own selection through the USER_FLAGS parameter, that 
selection will override NFLAG's defaults.

   Flagging the scans that you select. <P>
        SCANS   Flag scans manually; you will be given the option to select a 
                 secondary data cube for this operation. <P>
   Flagging on data statistics. The default flag type is CLIP. <P>
        MAXABCS Flag all scans in which the modulus of either the real (cosine) 
                 or imaginary (sine) part of any visibility falls outside a 
                 range to be specified. <P>
   Flagging on noise statistics. The default flag type is NOISE. <P>
        ANOISE  Flag all scans in which any of the four noise values (X/Y 
                 gain/phase) recorded in the latest NCALIB ALIGN or SELFCAL 
                 operation exceeds a threshold (yet to be prompted for). <P>
        XAN, YAN As ANOISE, but checking only the X resp. Y noise values. <P>
        RNOISE  Flag all scans in which any of the four noise values (X/Y 
                 gain/phase) recorded in the latest NCALIB REDUN operation 
                 exceeds a threshold (yet to be prompted for). <P>
        XRN, YRN As RNOISE, but checking only the X resp. Y noise values. <P>
   Navigation: <P>
        INSPECT Make detour into the (flag) INSPECTion section of the program 
        STATIST Make detour into the (data) STATISTics section of the program 
        MODE    Make detour into the enviornment MODE-control section of the 
                 program 
        CLEAR   Go to the CLEAR-flags operation. 
        QUIT    Return to FLAG_OPTION.  <P>

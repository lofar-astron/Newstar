<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Integer number; min.value: 0.000000.<P>
 PUT performs flagging commands from the internal flag list on 
your primary data cube. Each command consists of a flag/unflag mask plus ranges 
in the frequency- 
channel, interferometer, polarisation and hour-angle 'dimensions' of the TARGET 
points to which it must be applied. <P>
You have activated PUT's option to EXPAND, within the limits of the primary 
data cube, the operation over a 4-dimensional volume of data around each target 
point. You may now select the number of channels on either side of a target 
channel over which you want to expand the flagging.  Example: 
        If you reply 2, a total of 5 channels centered on each target channel 
will be flagged: two above and two below the target.  <P>

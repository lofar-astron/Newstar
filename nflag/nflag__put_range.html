<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Ranges for expansion volume around PUT points:|-chan.HA.ifr.pol 
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(8), 4 values.<P>
 PUT performs flagging commands from the internal flag list on 
your primary data cube. Each command consists of a flag/unflag mask plus ranges 
in the frequency- 
channel, interferometer, polarisation and hour-angle 'dimensions' of the TARGET 
points to which it must be applied. <P>
PUT has the capability to EXPAND, within the limits of the primary data cube,  
the operation over a 4-dimensional volume of data around each target point. 
The extension volume is specified through RANGES along the channel, hour-angle,  
interferometer and polarisation axes in this order. Except for interferometers,  
a range is formulated in terms of units of sequential position rather than 
physical coordinates. It can be one of the foloowing: <P>
   .            do not extend along this axis 
   *            extend to all positions along this axis 
   &lt;n&gt; or &lt;n&gt;C  extend over &lt;n&gt;/2-1 positions on either side (incrementing &lt;n&gt; 
                 if it is even) 
   &lt;n&gt;L         extend over &lt;n&gt;-1 positions to the 'left' (i.e. toward lower 
                 coordinates) 
   &lt;n&gt;R         extend over &lt;n&gt;-1 fields to the 'right' (i.e. toward higher 
                 coordinates) <P>
   The following special notations can also be used in each dimension: <P>
        &lt;n&gt;=0   suppress flagging altogether (length of the nextension cube is 
                 zero) 
        &lt;n&gt;=1   identical to . (length of extension cube is 1: no extension) 
   The following shorthand can be used for the entire reply: <P>
        *       short for 1, 1, 1, 1 or ., ., ., (You may do better to avoid this 
                 form because this use of a wildcard character is anomalous.) <P>
?  The interferometer range works on telescope basis, i.e. the given range is ? 
  valid for both receptors (e.g. 0Y and AX). 
!!              Clarify, it must be different from the other coordinates... <P>
Example: 
        If a particular ineterferometer is flagged in one of frequency 
channels,  
                PUT_RANGE= *, ., ., . 
 will propagate the flag to all channels for that interferometer  <P>

<H1>Program NFLAG: private keyword SELECT_FLAG</H1> 

<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Flag type(s) to use in data selection| NONE, ALL, MAN, CLIP, NOISE, ADD, SHAD , U1, U2, U3; [OLD]
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(16), 16 values.<P>
 Some operations test flags in selecting data. By default, NFLAG 
selects the test flags appropriate to each operation; only those data are 
accepted for which these flags are CLEAR. <P>
You may define here an alternative (set of) flag type(s) to be used in ALL 
subsequent testing operations; you may select more than one, separated by 
commas. Reply NONE to revert to the default settings. <P>
   ALL or *     test all flag types 
   MAN          test the flag type for the MANUAL class of operations 
   CLIP         test the flag type for the CLIP class of operations 
   NOISE        test the flag type for the NOISE class of operations 
   ADD          test the flag type for the ADDITIVE class of operations 
   SHAD         test the flag type for the SHADOW class of operations 
   U1, U2, U3   'user' flag types, i.e. types you may use as you please 
   NONE         revert to NFLAG's default types per operation <P>
   OLD          the flag type for the 'OLD' class (i.e. flagged before 
                 930609, and converted with NVS option) 
                 NB: OLD uses the same flag-bit as MAN 
!!              I suppose this can now be removed.

<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Real number.<P>
 Specify the diameter (m) of the telescopes. <P>
A telescope is 'shadowed' as soon as part of its aperture gets blocked by the 
presence of another telecope in its line of sight. This condition occurs when 
the projected baseline between the two telecopes becomes less than the 
telescope diameter D (25 m for the WSRT). If you want to retain as much as 
possible of your data, you may specify a somewhat smaller number (e.g. 0.8 D) 
to take into account the fact that the edge of the aperture is only weakly 
illuminated. <P>
For the hour-angles at which a telescope is shadowed, all intreferometers are 
flagged of which it is a part. The default flag-type is SHADOW. <P>
  ? Another flag may be selected through the FLAG_MODE parameter.  <P>

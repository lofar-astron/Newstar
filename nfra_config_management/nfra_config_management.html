<H1>Newstar configuration management at NFRA</H1>
<PRE></PRE>


<H2>General concerns</H2>

The Newstar package is not a static product. Major and minor changes are 
often being made to the software. These changes should affect the use of
the package in a positive sense only. Therefore we need to guard the
integrity of the package at NFRA and define clear procedures for external
users on how to upgrade their implementation. This document describes
those procedures. 
<P>
This document is limited to configuration management on the Unix systems.
The VAX system will be no longer supported at NFRA from 15/03/94, and 
can be maintained through the perl-scripts provided by WNB.
<P>
Reference to Newstar directories are made through the usual variables 
$n_src, $n_root etc. Refer to Appendix 2 for the details. 
<P>
All commands assume one is logged in as the Newstar Master (newstar).
<PRE></PRE>

<H2>What makes up the Newstar configuration at NFRA</H2>

The Newstar configuration at NFRA consists of the following:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>The NFRA-Master system</STRONG> on the /newstar disk (below $n_root):
  <OL>
    <LI>The Master source tree (below $n_src)
    <LI>The NFRA library and executable areas ($n_inc, $n_lib,
             $n_exe and $n_tst for the various architectures)
    <LI>The NFRA documentation area ($n_hlp)
    <LI>The NFRA import area (below $n_import)
  </OL>
  <P>
    Below /newstar/master we also have an installation of: (1) mongo (in
    /newstar/master/mongo), of (2) perl (in /newstar/master/perl) and 
    (3) a copy of the sources for the VAX-based Remote Tape Daemon (in
    /newstar/master/rmtd).
  <P>  
    This is a working system, used by NFRA users and programmers.
  <P>
  <LI><STRONG>The Export-Master system</STRONG> on the /users disk of ftp.nfra.nl:
  <OL>
    <LI>The Export Master source tree           (below $n_src)
    <LI>The Server version of the documentation (below $n_www)
      <UL>
        <LI>server homepage            $n_www/homepage.html
        <LI>documentation relevant to the Export Master source tree
                                       $n_www/hlp/
        <LI>user feedback system       $n_www/bug/
        <LI>link to mail area          $n_www/mail/
      </UL>
    <LI>Some server programs for ftp.nfra.nl    (below /users/newstar)
    <LI>The import area for sites outside NFRA  (/users/ftp/newstar/import)
  </OL>
  <P>
    This is a sources-only system which is never compiled.
    The Export Master source tree and the documentation are kept
    up-to-date from the NFRA Master system.
  <P>
  <LI><STRONG>The Newstar account</STRONG> on the NFRA Unix system (~newstar)
  <OL>
    <LI>Startup files for the newstar account (.cshrc and .login etc.). These 
        files should not contain commands that are essential for the 
        functioning of newstar apart from PATH settings and 
        the startup command:
<PRE>
#
# Initialise Newstar (either NFRA-Master or Export-Master)
#
if (-e  /newstar/master/src/sys/newstar_nfra.csh) then
 source /newstar/master/src/sys/newstar_nfra.csh
else if (-e /users/newstar/bin/newstar_init.csh) then
 source     /users/newstar/bin/newstar_init.csh
endif
</PRE>

    <LI>Mail environment (~/Mail and ~/.elm). The elm
        alias friends_of_newstar is used to inform on updates. The Newstar
        environment variable $n_master points to this eMail account.
    <LI>Server interface (~/server). This directory is used to pass commands
        to the server programs on ftp.nfra.nl
  </OL>
  <P>
    This account is the owner of the NFRA-Master and the Export-Master, and
    is the only account that can modify them (apart from $n_import and the
    locking database).

<H2>Relations between NFRA-Master and Export-Master</H2>

The dynamic relations between Master systems (either the NFRA Master or
another one) and Export-Master are as follows:
<PRE>

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
</PRE>
Use of the "<TT>nup release</TT>" command is restricted to the NFRA-Master.
Master systems outside NFRA use the "<TT>nup retrieve</TT>" command to get 
updated files from the Export-Master. The "<TT>nup update</TT>" command 
combines "<TT>nup retrieve</TT>" and "<TT>nup build -U</TT>".
<BR>The NFRA-Master uses the "<TT>nup retrieve -import ...</TT>" to get 
files from the Export-Master's $n_import (files checked in by 
programmers outside the NFRA).
<PRE></PRE>

<H2>Definition of revisions and releases</H2>

Every modification of files in the Master source tree results in a new
<EM>revision</EM>, even if the modification does not involve changes in the
executables. The procedure for merging modifications in the Master source
tree is described in the next section.
<P>
A <EM>release</EM> is defined as a revision which involves one or more of the
following items:
<OL>
  <LI>A change of fileformats, so you will have to use the 
        NVS (New Version) option in some programs
  <LI>A change in keyword syntax (so you will have to type different
         things or change batch files in some cases) other than an 
         additional keyword for which the default can be used.
  <LI>Addition of a new program, or a major rewrite of an existing one.
</OL>
The issue of a new release has to be decided upon by at least two members 
of the Newstar Project Team.
<P>
The updating of revision numbers is taken care of by the update script.
Releases need to be explicitly indicated. The procedure for this is 
described in a later section.
<P>
The version number of the current Newstar configuration is given
by the file  $n_src/sys/version.idx
<P>
A full description of the current Newstar configuration is given by 
the file  $n_src/sys/database.idx  after the command "<TT>nup check d</TT>"
<P>
A user-oriented decription of the configuration is given in the
file  $n_src/doc/nnews.hlp  which is shown by the command "<TT>nnews</TT>"
<P>
The version number of the Newstar executables is given by the
command 
<BR>"<TT>what $n_exe/*.exe | grep %NST%</TT>"
<P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H2>Checking-in modified files</H2>

When programmers (in or outside the NFRA) want to make a change in files 
in their Master source tree they have to use the "<TT>nsh in</TT>" command. 
This will ask (among other things) for a list of files to be checked in, for 
a comment and for the executables to be rebuilt (seprated by blanks). 
<P>
When programmers check in their modified files, these files are copied
into their local $n_import directory, together with a groupfile listing
the files and executables. The same files are copied into the $n_import
directory of the Export-Master. If the "<TT>nsh in</TT>" command is issued for 
(modified) files in a Master tree (presumably outside the NFRA), these 
files are not copied to the local $n_import. They are copied into the 
Export-Master. In all cases, a mail message describing the check-in is
sent to $n_master (currently newstar@nfra.nl).
<P>
Testing should be completed before check-in! At the NFRA, an executable 
and/or ppd-file supplied by a programmer can at request be copied into 
$n_tst for testing by a broader user-group. 
<PRE></PRE>


<H2>Merging modifications into the NFRA-Master source tree</H2>

When mail concerning a check-in is received, the following actions
should be taken:
<P>

<EM> 1e. If files originate from outside the NFRA, they should be 
     received in $n_import of the NFRA-Master (more than one 
     groupfile can be handled with a single update command):</EM>
<PRE>
  >>> nup retrieve -import updxxx.grp
</PRE>
<STRONG>Any file that has to be ftp'd with binary mode has to be retrieved
separately.</STRONG>
<P>
<EM> 2e. Perform some elementary checks: </EM>
<P>
If psc/pin/pef-files are changed, they should be checked against 
changes in keywords. If the meaning of existing keywords have been 
changed, the revision should be treated as a release (see the previous 
section). 
<P>
If keywords have been removed from a psc file, it should be checked wether
they have been removed from the programs as well. In such cases, special
care should be taken that executables are being rebuilt synchroneously
with the ppd-files. In general, removal of keywords is discouraged for 
revisions. 
<P>
NOTE: The synchronisation of exe/ppd files is not optimal in the present
      structure for configuration management, but cannot be improved 
      without structural changes in the coupling of exe and ppd files.
<P>
<EM> 3e. Update libraries and executables for all architectures:</EM>
<PRE>
  >>>  nup build -Update  updxxx.grp                   (on rzmws0)
  >>>  nup build -Update  updxxx.grp                   (on rzmws5)
</PRE>

Any errors reported by the build command should be reported to 
and repaired by the programmer. 
<P>
<EM> 4e. At successful compilation, merge the files in the source tree:</EM>
<PRE>
  >>>  nup build -Update -T:none -Merge updxxx.grp     (on rzmws0)
</PRE>

The revision number will be automatically updated in version.idx.
<P>
The subject from the groupfile(s) is copied in the nnews.hlp file, and a
message to be sent to local Friends of Newstar is composed (so enter
useful information). Both files will
be presented in the MicroEmacs editor (change buffers with ^X X command,
exit with Esc Z).
Comments concerning programmers only should be removed from nnews.hlp, or
be prefixed by "System: ". This checking of nnews.hlp is very important
since most users rely on this file for their information on changes.
The message is kept in $n_import/message.RR.rr where RR is the new Release,
rr the new revision of Newstar.
<P>
The message is not yet sent, this is done after the Export-Master has been
updated. 
<BR>This is done with the "<TT>nup release</TT>" command, discussed later.
A mail is sent to $n_master to remind you of this revision after three days.
<PRE></PRE>

<H2>Special procedure in case a groupfile needs to be deleted</H2>

If a groupfile needs to be removed from the Master, it should be explicitly
deleted using a command like 
<BR>"<TT>rm $n_src/xxx/yyy.grp</TT>" followed by a reconstruction of the 
database with  "<TT>nup check d</TT>".
<P>
At remote sides, the groupfile will be deleted automatically after the
next update.
<PRE></PRE>


<H2>Special procedure for new releases</H2>

If a modification is to be interpreted as a release, the following 
special actions need to be taken:
<OL>
   <LI>Check out file  $n_src/sys/version.idx
   <LI>Increase the release number by hand, set the revision number to 1
   <LI>Check in file $n_src/sys/version.idx
       <UL>
        <LI>The comment should clearly indicate the new release
        <LI>When asked for the executables to be rebuilt, answer:  @all
       </UL>
   <LI>Update the resulting groupfile in the master:
       <UL>
        <LI>Nnews should clearly reflect the new release
        <LI>The mail message has to be edited to mention the release explicitly
       </UL>
   <LI>The file $n_root/updates.html should be edited
       to reflect the new release. An example how to do this should be
       taken from header of the previous release. It should be decided
       wether the old revision history should still be kept in this file. 
       If not, the revision information should be replaced by the remark
<PRE>
         &lt;EM&gt;Revision history not recorded&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;P&gt;
</PRE>
       The description of previous releases should not be removed.
       Add a hypertext link to this release at the beginning of the file.
</OL>
<PRE></PRE>

<H2>Merging changes into the Export-Master</H2>

After the changes have been active in Dwingeloo, they have to be made 
known to the outside world. This is typically done after three days (to 
remind you, the above mentioned at-job is scheduled). 
<P>
The procedure to update the Export-Master is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
  >>>   telnet wsrt00
  >>>   setenv n_remote rzmws0.nfra.nl newstar /newstar/master/src
  >>>   nup update
</PRE>
This will try to update the Westerbork installation from the NFRA-master.
Any errors occurring here will almost certainly occur in other installtions
as well, so they need to be repaired before the next step. Should you choose
to make changes directly in the NFRA-Master, issue the following command
<STRONG>at rzmws0</STRONG> before trying to update wsrt00 again:
<PRE>
  >>>  nup check d
</PRE>
This will make a fresh version of the database. Once installation on wsrt00
is successfull, give the following command <STRONG>at rzmws0</STRONG>:
<PRE>
  >>>  nup release
</PRE>
This will rebuild the documentation, create a fresh database, pack
all sources, libraries and executables and send them over to the
Export-Master. It also tells the server program that files are waiting
to be unpacked. Once this has been done, the message will be sent. In 
case more than one release has been pending, a fresh message for the
most recent revision will be composed, containing all the subjects 
from previous revisions. The message will be sent to the Friends of Newstar.
This relies on an elm alias friends_of_newstar. 
<PRE></PRE>

<H2>Maintenance of server programs for the Export-Master</H2>

The server programs for the Export-Master are maintained outside the 
normal Newstar routine. All sources (programs, scripts and text-files) 
have to be in /users/newstar/src/. They have to be compiled or put in 
their proper place by executing the "<TT>make</TT>" command in that directory.
A "<TT>make</TT>" should be done after any change in files in /users/newstar/src.
Refer to file /users/newstar/src/Makefile for details about requirements 
for server programs.
<PRE></PRE>

<H2>Maintenance of the locking database</H2>

The locking database is there mainly for administrative purposes.
It warns users who check out a locked file, but still makes a copy for them.
However, it will prohibit checking in locked files. Since users sometimes
just delete files without unlocking them, the lock-file will get polluted.
Therefore the weekly routine includes cleaning up of this file.
<PRE></PRE>


<H2>Weekly routines for the Newstar Master copy at NFRA</H2>

Backups are made each Thursday afternoon or Friday morning. The procedure 
for backups is:
<PRE>
  >>>   nup check d  
</PRE>
This will build a fresh version of file  database.idx  
The database will be updated for any direct changes in the Master (that is:
without proper checkin through $n_import). 
<PRE>
  >>>   nup save
</PRE>
This will make a backup of the entire master tree (all files below $n_root).
Three DAT tapes are used for the backups (cyclic use of Newstar_A, Newstar_B
and Newstar_C). The save command will run in the background and notify
by mail when it is ready. 
<P>
The two most recent backups are stored at the Bank of Dwingeloo.
Backups of the Export-Master are made as part of the Scissor backup
routine.
<P>

After the backup, the following command should be entered:
<PRE>
  >>>   rm $n_exe/*.old $n_tst/*.old
</PRE>
This will throw away old versions, which can be restored from the backup
tape if necessary.
<PRE>
  >>>   nup clear -Confirm
</PRE>
This will remove any obsolete files from the Master copy. See above for
the deletion of obsolete groupfiles. Removing a file from a groupfile will
cause a prompt for deletion here. In such cases, check wether the file
has become really obsolete (e.g. by using a grep on the subroutine name).
If the file has been accidentally removed from a groupfile, check out
the groupfile, re-insert the file, check-in the groupfile and make a 
maintenance revision.
<PRE>
  >>>   nup check  l        (on rzmws0)
  >>>   nup check  l        (on rzmws5)
</PRE>  
This will check the current libraries. If faults are reported, the
libraries should be updated through the groupfile produced by the
check command (instructions are given by the command). The name of
the groupfile will be  libyymmdd${n_arch}.grp.

<H2>Appendix 1: Terminology</H2>

<DL>
<DT> Site:<DD>
             on or more computers that share a (Network) File System

<DT> Master-systeem:<DD>
   the officially installed Newstar version on a site

<DT> NFRA-Master:<DD>
      the master system at the Unix network of the NFRA,

<DT> Export-Master:<DD>
    the (sources-only) master system at the Unix network 
                    of the NFRA, distribution is done from this master.

<DT> User-systeem:<DD>
     a (partial) version of Newstar that is made by a user/
                    programmer based on the Master-system. When starting
                    an executable, a version in the user-system has priority 
                    over the Master.

<DT> Binary-tree:<DD>
      a directory tree in a Master or User system containing
                    the executable files needed to run Newstar (NB: you 
                    also need the startup scripts in $n_src/sys).

<DT> Source-tree:<DD>
      a directory tree in a Master or User system containing
                    only all files needed to install a binary tree 
                    (excluding the operating system and compilers...).

<DT> Library-tree:<DD>
     a directory tree in a Master or User system with libraries
                    and (for a User system) object files; one directory in the
                    library tree contains include files and system independent
                    pre-processed files, all derived from the source tree.

<DT> Work-directory:<DD>
   a directory for temporary files, for listingss and for
                    files needed for the debugger.
</DL>
<P>
The Master system has two binary trees:
<UL>
   <LI>$n_root/exe     No debugging information.
   <LI>$n_root/tst     Can be used for debugging, will usually be empty.
</UL>
<P>
Executable files are looked for in the current directory first, then
in $n_uexe (if it exists) and finally in $n_exe.
<P>
A user may decide to do "<TT>setenv n_uexe $n_tst</TT>" to get access to test versions,
and programmers will set $n_uexe to the binary tree of their user system.

Sites outside NFRA can have other architectures in $n_lib and $n_exe. 
At most sites outside NFRA $n_hlp is a subdirectory of $n_root/exe.

This structure can be split over various filesystems. The tree can than
be realised through symbolic links. Since all system commands use the
environment variables this is not strictly necessary.

Logging in as the owner of $n_root (Newstar manager) causes $n_u... 
to point to $n_..., $n_work will point to $n_root/work/$n_arch. 
If the Newstar manager uses the -NUpdate switch for update, $n_uexe
will be set to $n_tst, else it will be at $n_exe.

It is confusing that there is no $n_uwork, this departure from the 
general practice may be removed in future.

<H2>Appendix 3: Other programs and procedures related to Newstar</H2>

<H3>Mails concerning Newstar</H3>

A copy of all E-mail correspondention between the different members of the
Newstar group should always be send to HjV (hjvosmeijer@nfra.nl). He will
extract those documents and put them in his Newstar mail directory
(~hjv/public_html/newstar/mail). A printed version of the documents will be put in
a special binder which will be kept in HjV's room.
<BR>Every working-day at 07.00 AM a script will create an updated HTML
file (<A HREF=http://www.nfra.nl/~hjv/newstar/mail.html>mail.html</A>)
which gives everyone the possibility to read the mails and search for 
keywords using Mosaic. 



<H3>Newstar use</H3>

On every site where Newstar is installed, the programs will write an
entry (with username, programname, date a.s.o.) in the file 
$n_import/newstar.use. During an update of a site, this file is ftp'ed 
to NFRA (/users/ftp/pub/incoming) and a new (empty) version is
created on the updating site.
<BR>At NFRA every working-day at 07.00 AM a script will take care for
moving those new files to ~hjv/newstar/use, compressing the files and
merge them with the already existing files per site, create quarterly 
and monthly reports. The script will also update an HTML file 
(<A HREF=http://www.nfra.nl/~hjv/newstar/use.html>use.html</A>) 
which which gives everyone the possibility to view those reports 
by using Mosaic.

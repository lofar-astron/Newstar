<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(24).<P>
Specify the action to be performed: <P>
   Creating cuts from external data: 
	EXTRACT extract information from SCN file into cuts 
	COPY    copy cuts to other NGF file, retaining their indices 
		 (this action is mainly useful for discarding cuts no longer 
		  needed and thereby freeing disk space) <P>
   Viewing the contents of the .NGF file: 
	SHOW    show information in cut headers and data 
	BRIEF   show summary per group/field showing numbers of polarisations,  
		interferometers, cuts and data points <P>
   Calculations: 
	CALC    Perform one of a set of predefined algorithms on individual cuts 
	MERGE   Merge a number of cuts into a single new cut. 
		NOTE: Overlapping points will be averaged so you may use MERGE 
		      to average e.g. a set of interferometers with data points 
		      at coincident hour angles. 
	COMBINE Combine cut(s) in user-specified expression <P>
   Sorting: 
     Starting from a cut in the HA direction, these actions produce a new cut 
in the frequency or baseline direction for each hour angle present in any of 
the input cuts. Use the HA_RANGE parameter to limit the number of output cuts. 
     The output cuts are in a primitive format in which the data are transposed 
but NOT the coordinate axes. These wrong axes appear in plots of the transposed 
cuts and must be interpreted as indicated below. In calculations, however,  
coordinates will be interpreted correctly (provided you specify a sensible 
calculation). <P>
     Transposing a transposed group of cuts reproduces the original cuts. You 
may also try to combine TRANS and BASE operations but sensible results are not 
guaranteed. <P>
	TRANS   transpose frequency and HA axes. 
		In the transposed cuts, each channel is represented by an hour 
		angle of &lt;channel number&gt;*0.125 deg. 
		Each hour-angle bin of 0.125 deg is represented by a channel 
		number, which starts at 0 for the lowest hour angle present. <P>
	BASE    transpose interferometer and hour-angle axes. 
		In the transposed cuts, each baseline bin of 10 metres is 
		represented by an HA bin of .125 deg at HA = &lt;baseline&gt;/10*.125 
		deg; baselines landing in the same bin are averaged. 
		Each hour-angle bin of .125 deg is represented by a baseline 
		sequence number of HA*.125. <P>
   Plotting: 
	MONGO   output cut data in a MONGO-readable file 
	PLOT    plot data in NGF cut(s) <P>
   Miscellaneous: 
	DELETE  delete cuts. (Only the index linkage is removed but the cut data 
		 remain in the file: Use COPY to free the file space.) 
		BEWARE: This action is IRREVERSIBLE. 
	NODE    switch to other NGF file 
	QUIT    terminate NGCALC <P>
   Data-format conversions: 
	CVX     convert NGF file from other machine's format to local format 
	NVS     update to latest NGF-file format  <P>

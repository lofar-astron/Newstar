<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> AVER, SMOOTH, POLY, CPOLY, DPOLY, SHIFT, NULL, QUIT calculation type
<DT><EM>Default:</EM> QUIT.
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(24).<P>
Specify the action to be performed on individual cut(s). <P>
	AVER    average cut and report results <P>
    The following actions will create a new cut for each input cut with the same 
    index numbers except for a new SEQ number. <P>
	SMOOTH  create new cut(s) by smoothing cut data with a triangular 
		 function (whose halfwidth you will specify) <P>
	POLY    fit N+1 coefficients of an Nth-order polynomial 
		   P= c0 +c1*HA +c2*HA**2 +... +cN*HA**N 
		through cut data and create new cut(s) from the residuals <P>
	CPOLY   as POLY, but fitting only N selected coefficients of an 
		 Mth-order polynomial. M&gt;N; the missing coefficients are held 
		 at 0. (This method can be used, e.g., to fit a polynomial for 
		 which you know a priori that it must be even.) <P>
	DPOLY   subtract values of a polynomial (yet to be specified) from cut 
		 data and create new cut(s) from the results <P>
	SHIFT   create new cuts with visibility values transformed to a 
		 different sky position <P>
	NULL    create new cuts with data points in an HA range (yet to be 
		 selected) deleted <P>
	QUIT    leave CALC <P>
Note:   All calculations are done with complex numbers. To use e.g. only 
	amplitude, convert it first with an expression= AMPL(#..) in 
	a COMBINE action.

<H1>Description of general keyword DATAB</H1>

<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> default directory name
<DT><EM>Default:</EM> "" /NOASK.
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(80).<P>
Directory names can be very long. In order to avoid having to type them fully 
each time, the user may store it in the keyword DATAB (the name has historic 
roots). From then on, node names (in the same $stream) are automatically 
preceded by the contents of DATAB. <P>
NB: On Unix systems, the value of DATAB has to end with a slash (eg ./) <P>
If you set DATAB to "*", the DATAB keyword will be ignored completely (it will 
not be changed if you use a directory name in the specification of a set etc.) <P>
NB: In general, however, it is recommended to keep all files of a reduction 
project in a single directory. In that case, no explicit directory name will be 
needed in any case, if you run from this directory. <P>
Example: if node name is preceded by a directory name: 
        ../../wnb/wsrt/data/myproject/mynode the value of DATAB (for the 
current $stream) will be: 
        ../../wnb/wsrt/data/myproject/ Subsequently, typing 'othernode' will 
produce the node name: 
        ../../wnb/wsrt/data/myproject/othernode NB: IF THE NEWSTAR PROGRAM 
CANNOT FIND A FILE (NODE), WHILE IT IS CLEARLY PRESENT IN THE CURRENT 
DIRECTORY, CHECK THE VALUE OF DATAB!! <P>
This keyword is part of NGEN, i.e. it is a NEWSTAR 'environment keyword', which 
is available to all NEWSTAR programs. The switch /NOASK indicates that it is 
'hidden', i.e. the user is not prompted for it, but the default value is used. <P>
Its value may be modified (for a given $stream) in several ways: 
        Permanently for all programs and streams during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] 'NGEN$0' 
        Permanently for all programs in certain stream during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] NGEN['$stream'] 
        Permanently for certain program in all streams during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] 'program$0' 
        Permanently for certain program in certain stream during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] program['$stream'] <P>
Note: use automatic saving in LOGOUT to pass on values beyond current login 
        Incidentally for a certain incarnation of program[$stream]: 
                run as: dwe program['$stream']/DATAB='"value"' 
        Incidentally for all hidden values: 
                run a NEWSTAR program as: dwe program['$stream']/ASK <P>

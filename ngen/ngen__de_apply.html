<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Specify visibility de-corrections  ALL; NOOTH; NOEXT, NOREF, NOIREF, NOFAR; NOCLK, NOPOL; NOIFR, NOMIFR;|-NONE;   OTH;   EXT,  REF,   IREF,  FAR;   CLK,  POL; IFR,  MIFR;|-SHFT, NOSHFT, MOD, NOMOD|
<DT><EM>Default:</EM> NONE /NOASK.
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(8), 16 values.<P>
In general, the visibilties in a .SCN file are not physically modified. 
Instead, correction parameters are stored in the sector and scan headers of the 
.SCN file, to be applied 'on-the-fly' to the visibilities as they are read into 
memory to be processed. <P>
It is also possible, however, to make corrections more permanent by applying 
them to the visibilities as stored in the .SCN file. The pertinent correction 
parameters are reset to 0 in this process and their values transferred into a 
second set of correction parameters, the "applied" corrections. Thus, for each 
correction parameter &lt;xxx&gt; there is an 'applied' counterpart A&lt;xxx&gt;. <P>
Just like it is possible to apply corrections on-the-fly, it is also possible 
to     'de-apply' the 'applied' corrections on-the-fly. You may specify here 
which 'applied' corrections you want to de-apply in this way. <P>
The prefix 'NO' indicates that a correction must not be applied and would most 
likely be used in combination of ALL. <P>
        ALL or *       apply all available corrections 
        NONE or ""     apply no corrections 
        [NO]RED        redundancy corrections (telescope gain, phase) 
        [NO]ALG        align corrections (telescope gain, phase) 
        [NO]OTH        other telesc. gain/phase corrns (i.e. from calibrator) 
        [NO]EXT        extinction correction (elevation-dependent gain) 
        [NO]REF        refraction correction (elevation-dependent phase) 
        [NO]IREF       ionospheric refracion 
        [NO]CLK        clock correction 
        [NO]POL        polarisation corrections (dipole angle, ellipticity) 
        [NO]FAR        Faraday rotation 
        [NO]MIFR       multiplicative interferometer errors 
        [NO]SHFT       shift of centre of observations 
        [NO]MOD        subtract model <P>
NOTES: 
   1. If two options are mutually exclusive, the one specified last prevails,  
e.g. 
        NONE, CLK, POL    selects only the CLK and POL corrections; 
        CLK, POL, NONE    selects no corrections at all. <P>
   2. The only DE_APPLY correction type that is ever different from zero so far 
is MODEL. This type controls the subtraction of a source model strored 
internally in .SCN-file sector. <P>

This keyword is part of NGEN, i.e. it is a NEWSTAR 'environment keyword', which 
is available to all NEWSTAR programs. The switch /NOASK indicates that it is 
'hidden', i.e. the user is not prompted for it, but the default value is used. <P>
Its value may be modified (for a given $stream) in several ways: 
        Permanently for all programs and streams during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] 'NGEN$0' 
        Permanently for all programs in certain stream during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] NGEN['$stream'] 
        Permanently for certain program in all streams during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] 'program$0' 
        Permanently for certain program in certain stream during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] program['$stream'] <P>
Note: use automatic saving in LOGOUT to pass on values beyond current login 
        Incidentally for a certain incarnation of program[$stream]: 
                run as: dwe program['$stream']/DE_AP=value (or: 
                '(val1, val2, ...)') 
        Incidentally for all hidden values: 
                run a NEWSTAR program as: dwe program['$stream']/ASK <P>

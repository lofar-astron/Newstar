<H1>Description of general keyword INFIX</H1>

<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> node name shorthand
<DT><EM>Default:</EM> "" /NOASK.
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(80).<P>
NEWSTAR file names can be very long. In order to avoid having to type them 
fully each time, the user may store (part of) the node name in the keyword 
INFIX. From then on, the user may specify node names in a short-hand notation 
which contains a hash (#) character. The latter is automatically replaced by 
the contents of INFIX, to produce the full file name. <P>
Example: if part of the full node name is enclosed in brackets: 
        mynode.21(cm.yesterday.s.x.c.d.file.d)d the value of INFIX (for the 
current $stream) will be: 
        cm.yesterday.s.x.c.d.file.d Subsequently, typing '92#e' will produce 
the node name: 
        mynode.92cm.yesterday.s.x.c.d.file.de <P>
This keyword is part of NGEN, i.e. it is a NEWSTAR 'environment keyword', which 
is available to all NEWSTAR programs. The switch /NOASK indicates that it is 
'hidden', i.e. the user is not prompted for it, but the default value is used. <P>
Its value may be modified (for a given $stream) in several ways: 
        Permanently for all programs and streams during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] 'NGEN$0' 
        Permanently for all programs in certain stream during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] NGEN['$stream'] 
        Permanently for certain program in all streams during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] 'program$0' 
        Permanently for certain program in certain stream during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] program['$stream'] <P>
Note: use automatic saving in LOGOUT to pass on values beyond current login 
        Incidentally for a certain incarnation of program[$stream]: 
                run as: dwe program['$stream']/INFIX=value 
        Incidentally for all hidden values: 
                run a NEWSTAR program as: dwe program['$stream']/ASK  <P>

<H1>Description of general keyword LOG</H1>

For each run of a NEWSTAR program, logging information may be put into a 
LOG-file, for subsequent inspection (and clogging up your room). LOG-files are 
named with the first three letters of the program name (e.g. NCA), followed by 
yymmddhhmmssA.LOG in the current working directory. E.g. NCA940305163412A.LOG 
The most recent LOG-file for a program has an alias name equal to the program,  
and the extension .LOG (e.g. NCALIB.LOG). <P>
The LOG-file contains the values for all the parameter (keywords) that were 
used for this particualr program run, including the 'hidden' ones. It will also 
contain information about the program run itself, and any results. <P>
Specify what to do with the logging output: 
        NO:     Make no LOG-file (not recommended) 
        YES:    Make a LOG-file (preferred option, no line-printer output) 
        SPOOL:  Print the LOG-file on the printer at the end of the program run 
        CATEN:  Add the new info to the existing LOG-file for this program <P>
. 
This keyword is part of NGEN, i.e. it is a NEWSTAR 'environment keyword', which 
is available to all NEWSTAR programs. The switch /NOASK indicates that it is 
'hidden', i.e. the user is not prompted for it, but the default value is used. 
Its value may be modified (for a given $stream) in several ways: 
        Permanently for all programs and streams during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] 'NGEN$0' 
        Permanently for all programs in certain stream during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] NGEN['$stream'] 
        Permanently for certain program in all streams during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] 'program$0' 
        Permanently for certain program in certain stream during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] program['$stream'] Note: 
use automatic saving in LOGOUT to pass on values beyond current login 
        Incidentally for a certain incarnation of program[$stream]: 
                run as: dwe program['$stream']/LOG=value 
        Incidentally for all hidden values: 
                run a NEWSTAR program as: dwe program['$stream']/ASK <P>

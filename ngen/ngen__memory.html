<H1>Description of general keyword MEMORY</H1>

<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Specify memory units
<DT><EM>Default:</EM> 100000 /NOASK.
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Integer number.<P>
Specify the amount of memory to be used per buffer for some applications. These 
applications could run faster in some instances by increasing (if a lot of 
physical memory present) or lowering (if a lot of swapping) this Value. <P>
. 
This keyword is part of NGEN, i.e. it is a NEWSTAR 'environment keyword', which 
is available to all NEWSTAR programs. The switch /NOASK indicates that it is 
'hidden', i.e. the user is not prompted for it, but the default value is used. 
Its value may be modified (for a given $stream) in several ways: 
        Permanently for all programs and streams during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] 'NGEN$0' 
        Permanently for all programs in certain stream during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] NGEN['$stream'] 
        Permanently for certain program in all streams during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] 'program$0' 
        Permanently for certain program in certain stream during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] program['$stream'] Note: 
use automatic saving in LOGOUT to pass on values beyond current login 
        Incidentally for a certain incarnation of program[$stream]: 
                run as: dwe program['$stream']/MEM=value 
        Incidentally for all hidden values: 
                run a NEWSTAR program as: dwe program['$stream']/ASK <P>

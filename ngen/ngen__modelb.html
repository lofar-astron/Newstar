<H1>Description of general keyword MODELB</H1>

<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> default directory for model files
<DT><EM>Default:</EM> "" /NOASK.
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(80).<P>
For calibrator sources one usually want to use a generic model, and it is good 
practice to collect such models in a single directory. <P>
Newstar programs look for a calibrator model first in your 'preferred' 
directory, then in the directory defined by MODELB, and finally in the 
directory defined by the Unix environmant variable MODELB. The latter points to 
the standard WSRT calibrator models that are part of Newstar. <P>
NOTE: On Unix systems, the value of MODELB has to end with a slash (eg ./) <P>
This keyword is part of NGEN, i.e. it is a NEWSTAR 'environment keyword', which 
is available to all NEWSTAR programs. The switch /NOASK indicates that it is 
'hidden', i.e. the user is not prompted for it, but the default value is used. <P>
Its value may be modified (for a given $stream) in several ways: 
        Permanently for all programs and streams during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] 'NGEN$0' 
        Permanently for all programs in certain stream during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] NGEN['$stream'] 
        Permanently for certain program in all streams during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] 'program$0' 
        Permanently for certain program in certain stream during current login: 
                change the default value: dws[pecify] program['$stream'] <P>
Note: use automatic saving in LOGOUT to pass on values beyond current login 
        Incidentally for a certain incarnation of program[$stream]: 
                run as: dwe program['$stream']/MODELB='"value"' 
        Incidentally for all hidden values: 
                run a NEWSTAR program as: dwe program['$stream']/ASK <P>

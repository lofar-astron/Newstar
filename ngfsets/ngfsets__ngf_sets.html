	A NEWSTAR .NGF file contains visibilities and associated data for one 
or more objects. The basic unit of data is the CUT, which is a one-dimensional 
vector of some type of data extracted from a .SCN file. The data may be either 
visibilities or associated data such as corrections; they may be associated 
with an interferometer or with a telescope. Cuts are addressed through a CUT 
INDEX which is a string of six integers separated by dots: <P>
	grp.fld.chn.pol.iort.seq <P>
	A GROUP is basically an administrative unit, allowing the user to 
subdivide his data, e.g. per object. 
	The FIELD and CHANNEL are the field and channel numbers in the .SCN 
file of the observation from which the cut was taken. 
	POL is a number indicating the polarisation. For interferometer data,  
pol=0, 1, 2, 3 represents XX, XY, YX, YY. For telescope data pol=0, 1 represents X, Y. 
	Depending on the type of data, IORT is the interferometer or telescope 
number. (The former is difficult to interpret; rather use the SELECT_IFRS 
parameter if you want to select interferometers.) 
	The cut SEQuence number distinguishes cuts for which all five of the 
preceding indices are identical. It is your responsibility to know what the 
different seq values represent. <P>
	Index values start at zero. (Remember that for the CHN index 0 is the 
continuum channel.) <P>
	You may select SETS of cuts for processing through [ranges of] values 
for the ive indices, e.g. <P>
		2.3-5:2.*.1-7.*.2 <P>
The WILDCARD value '*' means 'all'. Each index may also be specified as a 
RANGE: &lt;first&gt;-&lt;last&gt;[&lt;:increment&gt;]. Indices omitted are assumed to be '*',  
i.e.  ...1.0  means *.*.*.1.0. For wildcards at the end the dots may also be 
omitted, i.e. 1.0 means 1.0.*.*.* <P>
	The notation 3-5:2 stands for 'from 3 through 5 in steps of 2'. The 
step must be positive. If it is omitted, it is taken to be 1 (as in '1-7' 
above). <P>
	Multiple cut SETS may be specified, separated by comma's: 
&lt;Set1&gt;, &lt;Set2&gt;, ... The associated NGF_LOOPS keyword allows even more looping 
over index values. <P>
IF YOU WANT TO BE REMINDED OF WHAT CUTS ARE IN YOUR FILE: 
	Type O or L in response to this prompt to get an Overview or Layout 
	of your .NGF file. <P>
IF YOU DO NOT YET FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THESE CONCEPTS MORE HELP IS PROVIDED: 
	Type '@' or '&gt;' to be prompted for each of the 6 indices separately,  
	with more specific explanation per index. <P>
IF YOU GET BORED WITH 6-NUMBER INDICES: 
	Absolute Cut nrs '#&lt;n&gt;' can be used as an alternative.

<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(24).<P>
!!                      POINT?? 
Specify the action to perform. <P>
   Loading/unloading visibility data or images for half-tone/colour display. The 
   visibility 'planes' or images that you select are stored in display memory 
   for rapid access. The number of pictures that you can store is limited by the 
   availablity of this memory. 
!!                      Correct? <P>
	MAP      Load images(s) from map (.WMP) files. 
	DATA     Load (corrected) data from visibility (.SCN) files <P>
   Select mode for flagging of visibility data on the display. The flags you set 
   will not yet be written back to the .SCN file, so you can freely experiment. <P>
	DOFLAG   Switch to Flagging mode for .SCN-file visibilities 
	CLIPFLAG Switch to Flagging mode using cliplevels 
	FLAG     Flagging in .WMP maps using the PGPLOT cursor in GIDS <P>
!! In this mode, no maps will be stored in GIDS (this allows you to flag in a 
!! lot of channels etc in a single command, without overloading the GIDS 
!! memory). In normal display mode, consequtive images will be stored in GIDS 
!! for playback (this sequence is reset with the GCLEAR command). 
!!                      Is this relevant? <P>
   Saving the flags you set on your display: <P>
	UNLOAD   Save flags list in a .FLF (binary file), from which you can 
		  then transfer to the .SCN file through NFLAG LOAD. 
	WRITE    Save flags list in an ASCII file, which you may manually 
		  edit before transferringt it to the .SCN file through NFLAG 
		  READ. 
	CLEAR    Clear flags list. 
!                       {\em see 
!                       \textref{NFLAG OPS_FLIST}{nflag_private_keys.ops.flist} 
!                       parameter }\ <P>
   Terminate current action sequence: <P>
	GCLEAR   Remove a sequence of loaded pictures. 
	NOFLAG   Switch back to normal display mode. 
	QUIT     Leave NGIDS (the GIDS window will remain on the screen). <P>

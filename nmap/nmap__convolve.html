This is the interpolation function to be used in horizontally and vertically 
interpolating the observed visibilities onto the rectangular grid to be used in 
the Fast Fourier Transform. <P>
The choice of function determines the detailed aliasing properties of the 
map(s). NMAP chooses appropriate horizontal and vertical width parameters for 
each. You may specify one of the following functions: <P>
   Gaussian-based: <P>
        EXPSINC Sinc*exp on 6*6 grid points: An 'approximation' to the ideal 
                 sinc (=sin(x)/x) function. This is the function selected as the 
                 default for map-making after extensive experience with all of 
                 the options available here. <P>
        GAUSS   Gaussian type over 4*4 grid points: The function used in the 
                 first years of WSRT operations; it was later replaced by the 
                 prolate spheroids. The expense in computing time is the same as 
                 for P4ROL. <P>
   Prolate spheroids: These function minimise the 'power' (= the integral of the 
    intensity squared) 'aliased in' from sources outside the map <P>
        P4ROL   Prolate spheroidal function with 4*4 grid points. 
        P6ROL   Prolate spheroidal function with 6*6 grid points: By using more 
                 points in the interpolation, this function pushes the aliasing 
                 down considerably, - at the expense of a factor two or more in 
                 computing time for the interpolation <P>
All the above functions may also be used in constructing a UV-plane for display 
(UV_COORDINATES=UV). <P>
For plotting visibilities versus baseline or interferometer 
(UV_COORDINATES=BASHA or IFRHA), they are of little use, and the default one 
would normally select is <P>
        BOX     Shift to nearest grid point.

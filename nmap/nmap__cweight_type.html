<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> GAUSS, LINEAR, NATURAL Circular weight type
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(8).<P>
ON TOP of the standard taper function which is circular in the equatorial UV 
plane, you nay specify a taper that is circular in the projected UV plane (i.e. 
the plane as seen from the field centre). You can select one out of the 
following functions: <P>
	GAUSS   exp -(&lt;projected baseline&gt;/CWEIGHT_VALUE)**2 <P>
	LINEAR  max (0, 1-&lt;projected baseline&gt;/CWEIGHT_VALUE) <P>
	NATURAL unity weight everywhere, i.e. no circular taper <P>
NOTE that the circular weighing does not replace the standard tapering, but is 
applied as an EXTRA weight function. This is probably not what you want; you 
may eliminate the normal tapering by specifying TAPER=NATURAL and 
UNIFORM=STANDARD to take into account the radial density dependence of measured 
visibilities. <P>

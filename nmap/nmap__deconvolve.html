<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Correct map for convolution taper (Yes/No) ?
<DT><EM>Default:</EM> YES.
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Logical.<P>
The interpolation (convolution) in the visibility domain results in a 
multiplication ('tapering') of the output map(s) and antenna pattern(s) by the 
Fourier transform of the convolving function; i.e., toward the edge of the map 
the sources, sidelobes and grating responses appear weaker than they actually 
are. <P>
By default this effect will be corrected for by dividing the map through the 
taper. A side effect of this correction is that the noise, which is uniform 
over the whole uncorrected map, is amplified toward the map edges. <P>
Here you are given the option to bypass this correction. e.g. because uniform 
noise is more important for your application than source fluxes.  <P>

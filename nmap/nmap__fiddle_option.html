<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Fiddle action| BEAM, DEBEAM, FACTOR; EXTRACT, COPY, LOAD;|-ADD, AVER, POL, ANGLE; SUM, CSUM, RSUM, MOSCOM; QUIT
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(8).<P>
Specify action to perform. <P>
   In-place modifications: Modify data of (an) input image(s): <P>
        BEAM    correct map for primary beam attenuation so it will represent 
                 the 'true' sky 
        DEBEAM  apply primary beam attenuation to map so it will reprsent the 
                 product of the 'true' sky and the primary beam 
        FACTOR  multiply image with a constant factor <P>
   Unary operations: Create 1 new image from each input image: <P>
        EXTRACT extract an area from (a) image(s) 
        COPY    copy image(s) 
        LOAD    read or write (an) image(s) in a foreign format (e.g. Holog) <P>
   Binary combinations: make (a) new output image(s) from (a) pair(s) of input 
   images: <P>
        ADD     weighted sum of two images: F1*image1 + F2*image2 
        AVER    weighted average of two images: 
                        (F1*image1 + F2*image2) / [abs(F1) + abs(F2)] 
        POL     degree of linear polarisation from Q and U maps: 
                        sqrt (Qmap**2 + Umap**2)] 
        ANGLE   polarisation orientation (radians) from Q and U maps: 
                        0.5*atan (Umap / Qmap) <P>
   Combinations of more than two images: <P>
        SUM     weighted summation of (a) set(s) of images in a single .WMP file 
                 (you will be prompted to select the weighing method) 
        CSUM    weighted summation of pairs of images. You will be prompted 
                 for (a) set(s) of "real" images and (a) set(s) of 
                 "imaginary" images and complex weighting factors. 
        RSUM    idem, but the complex weighting factors will be calculated 
                 based on a specified rotation measure. 
        MOSCOM  'mosaic combine': merge a set of maps (generally for different 
                 field centres) into one output map <P>
   Miscellaneous: <P>
        QUIT    Return to OPTIONS level  <P>

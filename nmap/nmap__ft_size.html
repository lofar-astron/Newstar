<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> FFT size
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Integer number, 2 values; min.value: 4.000000; max.value: 8192.000000.<P>
Specify the size of the Fourier transform in the horizontal and vertical 
directions. Note that for 8k*8k maps the number of points/beam should 
not be too close to 2 to stay within map size. <P>
If the size in both direction is &lt;= 17, a Direct Fourier Transform (DFT) will 
be made instead of the standard operation of interpolating onto a rectangular 
grid followed by a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). <P>
The standard operation suffers from 'aliasing' artefacts associated with the 
periodic nature of the FFT. These artefacts are suppressed, to a level that is 
generally acceptable, through a very careful choice of the convolution function 
used in the interpolstion to a rectangular grid, but they cannot be avoided 
completely. <P>
By avoiding the interpolation altogether, the DFT method is free from these 
aliasing effects. <P>

<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Map coordinate system|  B1950_J2000, APPARENT; REFERENCE, AREFERENCE
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(12).<P>
Specify the coordinate system for the map. <P>
There are two choices to be made: The first is whether the map is to be made in 
apparent coordinates for the epoch of the observation or in fixed-epoch 
coordinates. The latter are fixed for each instrument: B1950 for the WSRT,  
J2000 for the ATNF. The second choice is whether the 'reference position' for 
the map must coincide with the fringe-stopping centre or is to be specified by 
you. <P>
The reference position is the position at which the map plane is tangent to the 
celestial sphere; it defines the geometry of the map's (l, m) grid in terms of 
RA and DEC. <P>
The reference position is important for mosaic mapping: The FIDDLE/MOSCOM 
operation that combines mosaic subfields into a single large map will only work 
if all input maps have the same reference. <P>
For a single mosaic, the program by default uses the mosaic centre as the 
reference for all subfield maps. However, if you intend to combine multiple 
mosaics into a 'super-mosaic', only you can define the common reference centre 
that will be needed. <P>
You have the following options for your reply: <P>
   Reference position defined by the observation (i.e. coinciding with the 
    fringe stopping centre): <P>
        B1950_J2000   in epoch coordinates for the epoch defined by the 
                       instrument with which the observation was made: 
                        B1950 for the WSRT 
                        J2000 for the ATNF <P>
        APPARENT      in apparent coordinates at the time of observation <P>
   Reference position to be defined by the user through an additional parameter 
    REF_COORD: <P>
        REFER         in B1950_J2000 coordinates <P>
        AREFER        in APPARENT coordinates. Note that this will not work for

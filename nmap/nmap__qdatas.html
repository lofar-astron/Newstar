<DT><EM>Default:</EM> NO.

Maps are normally made directly from the .SCN-file visibilities. Answering YES 
here gives you access to some specials including <P>

<DT>        - making a map from model visibilities in the .SCN file; 

<DT>        - selecting visibilities from an annulus in the UV plane; 

<DT>        - clipping extreme amplitudes in an annulus in the UV plane; 

<DT>        - shifting the pointing centre to which the visibilities refer (and 
           consequently the centre of the map to be made from them). <P>

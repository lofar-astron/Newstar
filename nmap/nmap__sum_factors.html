<H1>Program NMAP: private keyword SUM_FACTORS</H1> 

<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Summing multipliers
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Real number, 8 values.<P>
Specify up to 8 weight factors by which the input maps have to be multiplied. 
If the number of weights you give is less than the number of maps to be 
combined, the weights will re-used in a cyclic fashion. <P>
Example: 
        1, -1 will average the first, third, ... maps in your WMP_SETS 
specification with the negated second, fourth ... maps. <P>
Note: When used together with the RSUM option, the weights will be used both 
for the Real and Imaginary map (they are real weights). <P>

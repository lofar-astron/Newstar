Specify what you want to do with the model list in core: <P>
   Consolidating/rearranging the list: <P>
        MERGE   Combine (point-) sources at the same position. 
                 Must have the same spectral index and rotation measure. 
                 Stokes Q, U, V are properly taken into account. 
                 CLEAN components are NOT combined with non-CLEAN comp. 
                 Extended sources are ignored. 
        RMERGE  As MERGE, but within specified radius (which may be 0). 
                 The (l, m) position of the strongest source is taken. 
                 CLEAN components are combined if at the same position. 
!!               Discard duplicates or add fluxes? See MODEL_ACTION MERGE 
!!               below 
        SORT    Sort source list in decreasing amplitude. (This will be done 
                 automatically when you write the list back to a .MDL file.) 
        FSORT   Sort on a specified field in source list (for subsequent 
                 display) <P>
   Modifying sources in the list: <P>
        CALIB   Calibrate the source list to a new amplitude and/or position 
        EDIT    Edit source list (an amplitude of zero will delete the source) 
        FEDIT   Edit a field in a range of sources 
        FLUX_KNOWN Toggle the 'unknown-flux' bit. When this bit is off, NCALIB 
                 will by default refrain from attempting a Selfcan gain 
                 solution. <P>
   Deleting sources in the list: <P>
        DEL     Delete sources 
        DNCLOW  Delete non-clean sources with low amplitudes 
        DCLOW   Delete clean components with low amplitudes 
        DAREA   Delete sources in specified area <P>
   Miscellaneous: <P>
        SHOW       Show the list. (You will be prompted for details) <P>
        QUIT       Quit model-handling.  <P>

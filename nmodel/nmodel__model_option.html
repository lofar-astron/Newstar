<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Model-list action| READ, WRITE, INTERN; CLEAR, ADD, MODIFY, SHOW; QUIT
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(24).<P>
Specify the action to be taken on the internal model list: <P>
   Transfers between the internal list and an external file: <P>
        READ   Read the components from a .MDL file on disk into the 
                program's model list. The default filename is the name of 
                the calibrator belonging to the most recently read sector,  
                derived from the fieldname and the frequency. .MDL files are 
                first searched for in the current directory or the directory 
                defined by parameter DATAB. If this fails, the file is looked 
                for in the directory defined by parameter MODELB and finally by 
                that defined by the Unix environment variable MODELB. <P>
               NOTE that reading is INCREMENTAL, so if you read the same 
                .MDL file twice, you will get every component doubled... <P>
        WRITE  Write the program's model list to a .MDL file. <P>
        INTERN This does not affect the list, but selects 
                the model stored in the scan-file(s). Selecting INTERN is 
                equivalent to setting DE_APPLY=MODEL. 
                You may use this internal model in combination with 
                components in the program's model list. 
!!                      To be sorted out... <P>
   Modification and display of the internal list: <P>
        CLEAR  Empty the program's model list and optionally its reference 
                coordinates. <P>
        ADD    Manual input of sources to add the list <P>
        MODIFY Enter a submenu with options to modify the model list: 

<DT>                  - by deleting sources from the list; 

<DT>                  - by editing entries manually; 

<DT>                  - by sorting (for subsequent display) the list: you will be 
                     prompted for a definition of the sort order; 

<DT>                  - by calibrating. 
!!                      What?? How?? <P>
        SHOW   Show the program's model list, you will be prompted for details. <P>
. 
        QUIT   Exit from model-handling.  <P>

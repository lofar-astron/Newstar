Specify how the update process should proceed: <P>
        SEPARATE        each source to be updated is looked at separately,  
                         and they are fiddled to cater for close sources <P>
        CLUSTER         sources are clustered to bypass closeness problems <P>
        COMBINED        all sources solved in one go, with sub-clustering <P>
        CONSTRAINED     use constraints and clustering. The standard 
                         constraint used is to fix all variables for all 
                         but the lowest intensity source <P>
        L&lt;type&gt;         Loop up to 20 cycles till convergence: 
                         Note that the loop option does not always 
                         work, and is very slow. Preferably use for a 
                         small number of well separated sources/clusters.  <P>

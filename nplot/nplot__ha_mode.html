<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Special HA plot coordinates ST, IST, SEQUENCE, ISEQUENCE
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(10).<P>
This parameter selects a coordinate conversion for the vertical (HA) plot 
coordinate in plots of .SCN-file entities. <P>
    ST          Sidereal time i.s.o. HA. This is useful for plotting a series of 
                 observations (e.g. calibrators-object-calibrators) in a time 
                 sequence, e.g. to survey interference. Vertical coordinate is 
                 ST in degrees <P>
    SEQUENCE    Pseudo sidereal time: Sidereal time is forced into an ascending 
                 sequence: When the start ST for a sector is less than that of 
                 the one just plotted, it is changed to make the new sector 
                 follow the previous one contiguously. Within each sector,  
                 vertical scale size is that of HA or ST, but the sectors are 
                 displaced in ST. Sectors are plotted in order of their index. 
                This mode is useful to stuff a lot of information into a single 
                 plot, e.g. to check for interference, but the plot may become 
                 too confusing. <P>
    I&lt;xxx&gt;      The prefix I indicates that you want to integrate scans; you 
                 will be prompted for the HA interval over which to integrate. 
                 As currently implemented, this mode is effective only for plots 
                 that have HA or (pseudo)ST as vertical coordinate. The plot 
                 scale for this coordinate will not be affected. <P>
NPLOT will set plotting mode according to your reply and return to the OPTION 
prompt. The mode will remain in force until you change it or NPLOT exits.    <P>

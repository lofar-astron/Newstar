At this point, data values have been normalised to lie within the interval 
[0, 1]. Halftones are represented by the same interval: 0=white, 1=black. You 
are now to define the transfer function F for mapping data values onto 
halftones: <P>
        halftone = F (normalised data value) <P>
   Continuous functions: <P>
        CONTINUE  a quadratic function (you will be prompted for the 
                   coefficients) 
        NONE      direct mapping: halftone level = normalised data value <P>
   Discontinuous functions: <P>
        STEP      F is a staircase function; halftone shades are generated by a 
                   stochastic algorithm 
        PATTERN   as STEP, but halftone shades are represented by a set of 
                   fixed patterns <P>
In selecting a method, bear in mind that the human eye is quite sensitive to 
density variations in light shades while very poorly perceiving the same 
variations in the dark shades; in other words, its response to density 
variations is quasi-logarithmic. <P>
To compensate for this, a quasi-exponential transfer function is suitable. The 
best approximation to this available here is a steeply quadratic function (i.e. 
specify CONTINUE here and consult the on-line help for the TRANSFORM parameter). <P>
You may judge the quality of your transfer function from the grey-scale wedge 
that will appear side by side with your plot.  <P>

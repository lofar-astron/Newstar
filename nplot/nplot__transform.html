<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Grey-scale transfer coefficients:|-
up to 5 groups of 2 limits plus 3 coefficients of quadratic|
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Real number, 5 values, min: 3.<P>
Specify the range coefficients for the CONTINUOUS quadratic transfer function 
that you selected. 
!               {\em parameter \textref{HALFTONE}{.halftone} } <P>
Remember that the data at this point have been normalised to the range [0, 1]. 
You may specify 5 values, of which the first three are REQUIRED: <P>
        m, M     Range of normalised data values to be represented by the full 
                 halftone range. Values outside this range will be truncated. 
        a, b, c   The 0-th through 2nd-order coefficients in the transfer 
                 quadratic. <P>
The result will be ('ndv' = normalised data value): <P>
        ndv &lt; m:         OUT = 0                         (white) 
        m &lt; ndv &lt; M:     OUT = a + b*IN + c*IN*IN        (grey scale) 
        ndv &gt; M:         OUT = 1                         (black) <P>
You may break the IN range up into partial ranges by specifying multiple sets 
of m, M, a, b, c separated by semicolons, or specifying the sets one by one as the 
prompt is repeated. Input will be considered complete when you give no new 
reply. <P>
Examples: 
        standard linear, halftone=ndv:  0, 1, 0, 1 
        ndv distance from .5:           0, .5, 1, -2; .5, 1, -1, 2 
        four grey levels:               0, .25, 0; .25, .5, .25; .5, .75, .5; .75, 1, 1 
        an approximation to an exp 
         that seeks to match the 
         quasi-logarithic response 
         of the human eye:              0, 1, 0, .1, .9  <P>

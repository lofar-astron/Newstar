Checking in a WSRT tape has two phases. In the first phase, the ARC option 
CHECK is used to verify the general integrity of the tape. The tape is listed 
and all blocks are read. In the second phase labels are copied to the archive 
medium (with the DUMP option) and the Scissor database is updated through ARC 
option ARCHIVE. <P>

<H1>Program NSCAN: private keyword HAB_OFFSET</H1> 

<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Start-offset (sec)
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Real number.<P>
Specify the time-offset from the start of an observation, at which the 
integration for the output scans should start. Example: an offset of n will 
throw away the first n (rounded up to a multiple of 10) seconds of data. <P>
NOTE: This feature was useful in early mosaic experiments in which the slewing 
between fields occurred in the first integration interval(s) on the new field. 
It is now standard practice to slew during the final integration interval on 
the old source.  <P>

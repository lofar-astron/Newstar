<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> integration time (sec)
<DT><EM>Default:</EM> 120.
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Integer number; min.value: 10.000000; max.value: 3600.000000.<P>
Specify the desired integration time per output scan in seconds. <P>
120 sec is a good default; a lower value should be selected if visibilities 
vary rapidly as a consequence of the source distribution in the observed field,  
atmospheric conditions or interference. <P>
For standard observations, the number must be a multiple of the basic 
integration time used for the observation (which is some multiple of 10 sec). <P>
In WSRT mosaic observations, slewing occurs in the last 10 sec of the dwell 
time on each subfield. The integration time you specify must therefore at most 
be &lt;dwell time&gt; minus 10 sec. You may also use a submultiple of this value 
without losing data. <P>
    Example: 
        If the dwell time is 90 sec, there is 80 sec of valid data. HA_INT = 80,  
    40, 20 or 10 will use it all. However, HA_INT = 30 or 60 will result in the 
    loss of the last 20 sec. <P>
        The volume of your data in the .SCN depends primarily on the 
integration time. For each integration interval a 'scan' is created which 
consists of <P>
        &lt;nr of polarisations&gt; * &lt;nr of interferometers&gt; * 12 + 1024 bytes <P>
Model visibilities which may be added later will occupy another <P>
        4 * &lt;nr of interferometers&gt; * 12 bytes .                 NOTE: 
        The WSRT runs on Universal Time; the quantum of integration time is 
therefore 10 UT seconds, and a full 12-sidereal-hour observation contains 
somewhat less than 12*360 of these quanta. You can mostly ignore this subtlety,  
but the difference may be of practical importance in some situations.   <P>

Specify the action to be performed by the program NSCAN: <P>
   Operations on WSRT 'circle' observation files (on classical, DAT or Exabyte 
   tape, magnetic or optical disk): <P>
        LOAD     transfer observed visibilities into a .SCN file. 
        IFLOAD   same, but also transfer the 'IF' data (total powers etc). The 
                  extra data will enlarge the .SCN file by some 30%; you need 
                  them only if you suspect that the on-line gain calibration has 
                  been incorrect. 
        LEIDEN   transfer observed visibilities from standard LEIDEN file into a 
                  .SCN file 
        LIST     show contents of selected labels 
        ARC      as list, but update the Scissor database if at NFRA 
        DUMP     copy selected label(s) byte for byte into a disk file <P>
   Conversion to and listing of data in FITS format <P>
        UVFITS   convert .SCN file to UVFITS tape/disk file for use in AIPS 
        PFITS    print AIPS-like FITS info (but also other) from UVFITS file 
                   header <P>
   Display and editing of .SCN files: <P>
        SHOW     show/edit data and header information in .SCN file. (This 
                   option is duplicated in NFLAG.) <P>
   Utilities: <P>
        QUIT     leave the program NSCAN <P>
        CVX      convert a .SCN file from other machine's number format 
        NVS      convert a .SCN file to newest version. Needs only to be run if 
                   programs report that the data has the wrong version 

<DT>                  - calculates parallactic angle for ATNF 
        NOPT     update contents of sector/scan headers and polarisation format 
                  of visibility data: 

<DT>                   - convert input data in Stokes parameter format to XX format 

<DT>                   - calculate UT start 

<DT>                   - calculate precession rotation angle if not filled 

<DT>                   - recalculate MJD for observations aborted at Wbork 
        REGROUP  create a second index for each of one or more sets of sector.! <P>
   One-time fixes: <P>
        FROM_OLD convert old (R-series) uv-data file into NEWSTAR .SCN file 
        WERR     correct one-time mosaic WSRT tape errors (1991 data only) 
        AERR     change sign of phases 
        VFIX     recalculate velocities <P>

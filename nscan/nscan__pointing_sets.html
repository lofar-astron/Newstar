<H1>Program NSCAN: private keyword POINTING_SETS</H1> 

<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Mosaic field sequence number(s)
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Integer number, 512 values.<P>
 Select the SEQUENCE numbers of the fields (= mosaic 'pointing 
centres') to be selected. (see Note below). <P>
NOTE that WSRT mosaic fields are numbered starting at 1 <P>
   '*' selects all fields <P>
   '&lt;begin&gt; TO &lt;end&gt;&gt; BY &lt;step&gt;' selects fields &lt;begin&gt;, &lt;begin&gt;+&lt;step&gt;, ... 
        up to &lt;end&gt;. The 'BY &lt;step&gt;' part may be omitted. 
   BEWARE: The notation &lt;begin&gt;-&lt;end&gt;:&lt;step&gt; will be interpreted as an 
        expression and give incorrect results <P>
Each of the selected fields will be stored in the .SCN file as a separate 
'field' (fld) under the current 'group' and 'observation' grp.obs. (Remember 
that .SCN file 'sectors' are identified by indices grp.obs.fld.chn.seq). <P>
NOTE: 
        The numbers you specify refer to the SEQUENCE (starting with 0) in 
which the mosaic fields aqppear on the tape. Normally, an observation starts 
with field 0 and the sequence numbers equal the field numbers. However, if your 
observation starts 'somehere in the middle', this is no longer the case and you 
must be careful in selecting your fields. Example: <P>
        Your observation starts at field 19. To select fields 19 through 24,  
specify POINTING_SETS= 0 TO 5.  <P>

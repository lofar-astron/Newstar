<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Edit: name [offset][/length][:format] , val [, ...]
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(80), 16 values.<P>
The preceding sequence of parameter values that you provided defines one header 
or data structure being processed. The EDIT parameter now allows you show 
and/or edit the values of individual (goups of) fields in this structure. All 
fields may be modified, except for the pointers that define the structure of 
the file. <P>
NOTE: Although EDITing may be used to patch up a file, it is really intended 
only for debugging/testing purposes! 
        Newstar programs provide a number of manual-input operations that cover 
all situations expected in normal practice. In the rare cases that a file is 
systematically corrupted in a curable way (e.g. because of an error in the WSRT 
on-line program), the preferred course is to have an ad-hoc extension made to a 
Newstar program to process the damaged file(s). <P>
The following operations are available: <P>
   *                 show values of all fields in the structure 
   :                 show format information for all fields in the structure 
   &lt;name&gt;            show value(s) of field &lt;name&gt; in the structure 
   &lt;name&gt;:           show format information for field &lt;name&gt; in the structure 
   &lt;name&gt;, &lt;value&gt;, .. write &lt;valye&gt; in filed &lt;name&gt; in the structure <P>
   Instead of &lt;name&gt; you may specify a hex number (absolute address in the file) 
   or a hex number preceded by a '.' (address in the file relative to the origin 
   of the current structure) <P>
. 
Values are assumed to be in format of printout. Radix can be changed by 
prefixing with %X, %B, %O or %D. Angles are in degrees, but can be given as 
hh:[mm[:ss[.ttt]]] or dd.mm.[ss.ttt] <P>
'name' can be followed by (offset) to start at position offset in multi-valued 
list; and/or /number to limit number of values in same <P>
A full name specification can be followed with either: 
   :format               to change printing and reading format. (format can be 
                        e.g. {USX}{BIJ}  {ED}[n[.m]] {EC|DC}[n[.m]] 
   ::type[(off)][/n]     where type specifies a header type (e.g. STH) to format 
                        the indicated disk area as this type 
                        Single letter types are dummy header types for simple 
                        formats 
  ::                    gives all known header types

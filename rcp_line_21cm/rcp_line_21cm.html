<P>
This recipe deals with the reduction of a 21cm line dataset. It describes the calibration of the (complex) passbands using one or more calibrators, the flagging of bad data and the production of an image cube. It shows you how to display this image cube in a movie-like fashion using GIDS. The recipe also includes a description of how to visually identify groups of bad datapoints (e.g. bad interferometers or bad channels) and flag/clip those data. If the field is littered with bright continuum sources at the edge of the field, or when you are working with a relatively wide band, the subtraction of the continuum in the image plane will produce undesirable chromatic effects (the continuum emission itself will go away but not their frequency- scaled sidelobe and grating-lobe responses). A simple procedure to remove the continuum in such cases will be given.

This recipe describes the series of steps to go through when you want to calibrate a WSRT 21cm line observation. It assumes that the S/N in the data is rather low and that selfcalibration is not required. It also assumes that you do not have to clean the final images.

<H2><A NAME=SECTION0005100000000000000> <b>Load your data</b></A></H2>
<P>
Log in on the computer on which you want to read in the data. At present this is either the microVAX (RZMVX4) or the Alliant. You load data with the program NSCAN, option LOAD. Before you load your data you must know with what time resolution you want to read in the data, and which channels you wish to process. If your object is confined to a small region (say less than 10 arcmin) it may be sufficient to use 120 seconds averaging. If you wish to synthesize bigger fields I recommend using 60 seconds averaging, in order to avoid too much tangential smearing. If the data were Hanning tapered in Westerbork reading in every other channel may speed up the processing by a factor of two. Hence for a 32 channel observation you could answer at the channel question: &quot;2 to 28 by 2&quot;. Reading in the continuum channel (channel 0) is generally not necessary; it contains continuum data with contaminating line emission. It is also advised to read in the calibrator data into the same scanfile. If you do this in the second jobstep the data will be assigned the next highest 'group index'.
<P>
<A NAME=.detail.inspdata><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="../icons/invis_anchor.png"></A>  
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0005200000000000000> <b>Inspect the file layout and flag/clip bad points</b></A></H2>
<P>
To find out how the data in the file is organized, and how you can access certain subsets of it, it is suggested to move 'up and down' within the program NSCAN. There are five levels of actions to choose, all of which work on different parts of the dataset. The layout of the file, or the function of the five-digit 'index' that points to the various observations, channels etc. is particularly important to memorize. To avoid that obviously bad points (e.g. correlator spikes) ruin the calibration solution you may wish to flag ('delete') any points with a value higher than a certain limit.  Usually the occurrence of correlator spikes is noted on the information you receive from Westerbork/Dwingeloo. Flagging is done on a point-by-point basis using the amplitude of the visibility. Be careful when you use this option if you have no information on the amplitude range which is normal. Preliminary clipping of calibrator data is generally not necessary. During program execution it will inform you at which hourangles interferometers have been clipped.  The cutoff value for the object data can of course be much lower. When visibility samples have been clipped they will be ignored in all programs. You can also undo any clipping; you do this by first typing &quot;undelete&quot; at the question where the type of flagging criterion is selected (HA, AN, RN, IFR, CLIP ...).

<A NAME=.detail.passband><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="../icons/invis_anchor.png"></A>  
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0005300000000000000> <b>Determine the instrumental gains/phases across the passband</b></A></H2>
<P>
Run the (self-)calibration program NCALIB (option redundancy) for the calibrator source(s). In order to do this you need a 'model' for the calibrator field containing the fluxes and positions of the calibrator source and any (strong) surrounding sources (see Recipe 013: Using external calibrators). Depending on observing frequency and source there could be anywhere between one and many hundreds of sources in the model file. Upon execution the complex gains are determined, and stored, per telescope/polarisation for each time interval and channel.
<P>
<A NAME=.detail.plotcal><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="../icons/invis_anchor.png"></A>  
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0005400000000000000> <b>Plot the calibration results</b></A></H2>
<P>
In order to decide which calibrator(s) to use, or which part of the calibration observation, you must inspect the quality of the output from the calibartor NCALIB run. Both the printed LOG from the previous step and/or a plot of the telescope complex gains and the residuals from the (self-) calibration solution are helpful to make up your mind. The program NPLOT (options 'telescope' and 'residuals') does the plotting. In general it suffices to plot one channel, somehwere in the middle of the band, to judge the quality of the gains (called amplitude) and phases for the various telescopes. Phase and gain slopes across the passband are usually the same, to first order, for all telescopes. Phase drifts at 21cm are typically a few degrees of phase over a 12 hour period; gain drifts  
should generally be less than a few occasionally be larger. Consult the printout which contains summary information for each channel. If there are no instrumental problems the gain and phase errors should be equal to the thermal noise values (see Appendix ....).

<A NAME=.detail.transcal><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="../icons/invis_anchor.png"></A>  
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0005500000000000000> <b>Transfer the gains/phases from the calibrator(s)</b></A></H2>
<P>
The corrections from the calibrator(s) are averaged over all available (non- flagged) hourangle scans and stored in each scan of the object scanfile. If your calibrator observations have equal length, and no scans have been flagged, the resulting value is just the mean of the individual calibrator averages. There is no provision to weight for the S/N ratio or the amplitude of the calibrator. This means that the transferred gains/phases are representative for a point in time halfway the time of the calibrator observations. This would be a good assumption for gain/phase drifts that go linear with time. For galactic 21cm line observations you will have calibrators observed at frequencies lower and higher (usually by about 1 MHz) than the frequency of your object. Usually these are scheduled before and after the time of observation of your object but this is not essential. If the calibrator observations have equal length then the averaged gain/phase would be appropriate for a frequency halfway the calibrator frequencies as if there is a linear gain/phase drift with frequency. If your object frequency is not halfway in frequency between the frequencies of the calibrators and you want to store gains/phases in your object file that refer to the frequency of your object, on the assumption that the gains/phase vary linearly with frequency, than you may play around with the length of the respective calibrator observations. This can be done using the NSCAN program (option DELETE, suboption HA (delete).

<H2><A NAME=SECTION0005600000000000000> <b>Make a cube of images</b></A></H2>
<P>
Assuming that you do not want to selfcalibrate the object data (which for line observations is usually the case) you can now proceed to make an image cube. When making images you want to delete any obviously bad baselines. Because you do not yet know whether such bad baselines exist you might as well proceed with making your first series of images. It is possible to exclude visibilities that have an amplitude higher than a certain value. This clipping is not permanent, but only for the execution of NMAP. If the images look good, then all participating baselines are probably good. In an observations with 32 frequency channels, channel 1,29,30 and 31 are usually of poor quality so one would make maps of channels 2 through 28 only. Note that the 3d digit in the index of the 
.WMP cube will always start counting at 0 and continues through 26. That is, channel 2 is really designated 0.0.0 and channel 28 is 0.0.26.

<H2><A NAME=SECTION0005700000000000000> <b>Visual inspection of images</b></A></H2>
<P>
Making final, good quality, images is generally an iterative procedure where you work in both the image plane and the UV-plane. This procedure is fastest if you can load the cubes directly into the memory of your display (e.g. X- terminal or workstation). GIDS, the Gipsy Image Display System, is a very useful program to do this. Currently it only runs on the Sun If you want to analyse the images in detail, using programs in GIPSY or AIPS) you will have to make FITS-images first. This can also be done using NMAP (option w16fits or w32fits) but is not shown here. Before you can run GIDS (via dwe NGIDS) you have to switch to an X-terminal (in Dwingeloo we have four HP X-terminals) or one of the two colour displays on the SUN (IPX's).

<H2><A NAME=SECTION0005800000000000000> <b>Subtract the continuum form the line channels</b></A></H2>
<P>
After inspecting the cube of line images you can decide which channels to use for the continuum. Use the option FIDDLE (suboption SUM) to create an averaged continuum image. Then use the option ADD to add the continuum channels with weight -1 to each line image to create continuum-free line channels.

<H2><A NAME=SECTION0005900000000000000> <b>Make a cube of the corrected visibilities</b></A></H2>
<P>
If the continuum-free line images look fine you are finished. However, there may be problems at some low level caused by interference, correlator errors or telescope/interferometer errors. Problems at certain position angles in the images correspond to certain hourangles and could be due to short-lived interference. An error pattern in the images, which is centered on the field centre (fringe-stopping centre) and not on strong continuum sources, shows that we are dealing with an additive, rather than multiplicative, error suggests that we are dealing with (DC-) offsets in the backend. To find out which baselines are causing the damage you can make a cube of the (calibrated) visibilities before they are gridded and transformed. You should use the option BASHA instead of UV in NMAP to generate such a cube. Answers to the questions on FFT and map size should be the defaults that are suggested. The best way to pick up low-level problems in the data (e.g. small offsets) is to create outputs for the real (COS) and imaginary (SIN) data. Working with the amplitudes and phases is generally only useful if you want to identify problems of a multiplicative nature and when the signal is well above the noise per visibility point.

<P>
The cube of UV-data has a different size than that of the images. With samples of 240 sec there are about 180 points in the horizontal direction and 152 points in the vertical direction (4 x 38). By choosing an 18m baseline increment when making the cube you will get the various baselines well separated and makes it easier to count on the screen which baselines are bad. The shortest baseline (9A=72m) is at the bottom of the 'image'. You can now proceed to make a new series of images where baseline 5B should be thrown out. Then you can define the 'continuum' channels and run NMAP to calculate an average continuum channel. This is not shown here because you may want to do this all in GIPSY or AIPS using FITS images. For the purpose of the demonstration this was done in Dwingeloo and the final 'continuum corrected' cube shows images of channels 7 though 23. These images were 512 x 512 in size and covered an area of 0.6 degrees.

<H2><A NAME=SECTION00051100000000000000> <b>Make contour plots of images</b></A></H2>
<P>
Use the program NPLOT, option MAP to make contour plots of images. There is a variety of output devices. In Dwingeloo you could first send a plot to a (graphics-) terminal  (option REGIS) to check the contourvalues that you would like to plot. When you are satisfied you can, by using the 'loop' option, send a series of plots to the QMS plotter in either portrait (QMSP) or landscape (QMS) mode. The former gives you, for square plotareas, somewhat more space to plot in, if at least you want to restrict yourself to a single A4 sheet. Dealing with the size question will take some experience. The default size of 1,1 will give you a plot of at most 5 inch. This is the case if the number of grid points is a power of two (32, 64, 128 etc). When using a size greater than 1,1 on a power-of-two image area in landscape mode the plot will not fit on one sheet and you have to use scissors and tape. On the portrait mode you can actually increase the size to 1.4,1.4 before it needs more than a single A4 sheet.

If the inspection of the continuum subtracted image cube shows imperfections due to bad data or poor continuum subtraction you have to continue the reduction a bit further.

<H2><A NAME=SECTION0006100000000000000> <b>Further flagging of bad data.</b></A></H2>
<P>
If the inspection of the visibility cube using NGIDS has indicated that there are errors in certain hour-angles or baselines you can flag these using the delete option in NSCAN. If there are only bad baselines you can also decide to exclude these baselines when preparing the specifications for a new NMAP. That is, you do not have to actively delete them.
<P>

<H2><A NAME=SECTION0006200000000000000> <b>Make a new image cube.</b></A></H2>
<P>
If the new image cube shows, after subtracting some averaged continuum image, residual (chromatic) grating rings due to strong sources at the edge of the field you need to subtract these sources in the original UV-data.

<A NAME=.remain.sourcepar><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="../icons/invis_anchor.png"></A>  
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0006300000000000000> <b>Finding and updating discrete source parameters.</b></A></H2>
<P>
In order to determine the flux densities and positions of these sources you search the continuum image using the FIND option in NMODEL. To improve the estimates of flux and coordinates you can use the UPDATE option in NMODEL. A single update, using only the UV-data with coninuum emission, usually suffices. 
 The update algorithm will only work for discrete (point) sources. If there are extended sources with residual grating lobes you need to use NCLEAN (option Beam) to decompose that source into a number of delta- functions. The final list of components (updated discrete sources and clean- components) can be merged into one model file.

<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> OBS, ALTOBS, FLD, CHN, SCT Detail level for overview
<DT><EM>Default:</EM> OBS.
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(10).<P>
 Specify the level for the overview. <P>
To get a quick overview of the entire file, use <P>
	OBS     Shows a summary per observation (2nd index) listing the type of 
		 observation, the fieldname, the sequence number ('Volgnummer'),  
		 project number and UT date and time and the breakdown in 
		 numbers of fields, channels and sectors and polarisations <P>
To get more other details (frequency, bandwidth, HA range, number of scans and 
number of interferometers),  use <P>
	ALTOBS  for one line per observation 
	FLD     for one line per field in all observations 
	CHN     for one line per channel in all fields in all observations 
	SCT     for one line per sector in all channels in all fields in all 
		 observations <P>
NOTE: Depending on what is in your file, the volume of output in the latter 
three modes may be quite large. If you are not interested in the difference 
(e.g. in hour angle) between sectors, do not use SCT; if you are not interested 
in the differences (e.g. in frequency) between channels, do not use CHN. <P>
There is presently no mechanism to select only specific groups or observations 
for display.

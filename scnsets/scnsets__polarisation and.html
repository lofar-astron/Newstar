 Quick reminders: =============== 

<DT>   - L gives you a quick summary of the groups in your .SCN file 

<DT>   - O gives you access to more detailed overviews in various levels of detail 

<DT>   - #&lt;n&gt; is a synonym for the grp.obs.fld.chn.seq index that is sometimes 
	convenient to use. # ('absolute') sector numbers are shown in most 
	displays that show sector indices. 

<DT>   - A loop is specified by the number of cycles and the index increment per 
	cycle. Loops may be nested. <P>
The loop concept in full: ======================== 
	A loop specifies repeated execution of your operation. It is defined by 
the number of cycles and the increment per cycle for the sector indices: <P>
	&lt;n_cycle&gt;, &lt;grp_incr&gt;.&lt;obs_incr&gt;.&lt;fld_incr&gt;.&lt;chn_incr&gt;.&lt;seq_incr&gt; <P>
Later you will define, through the SCN_SETS parameter, the sector set to be 
processed in the first cycle. 
   Example: 
	SCN_LOOPS= 3, 0.0.2.1.0 
	SCN_SETS= 2.*.0-2.3.0, 2.*.1. 
   requests your operation to be executed three times, with sector sets 
	2.*.0-2.3.0     (SCN_SETS value) 
	2.*.2-4.4.0     (SCN_SETS + 1*increment) 
	2.*.4-6.5.0     (SCN_SETS + 2*increment) <P>
In the increment value, 0s and trailing dots may be omitted. Negative 
increments are permitted. <P>
Loops may be nested by giving more than one cycles-increment pair; in this case 
the rightmost loop is executed inside the loop to its left. 
   Example: 
	SCN_LOOPS= 2, .1, 2, ..1 
	SCN_SETS= 0.0.0.*.0 
   results in your operation being performed on the following sequence of 
   sectors: 
	0.0.0.*.0 
	0.0.1.*.0 
	0.1.0.*.0 
	0.1.1.*.0 <P>
Some fine points: ================ 
	Loops are a useful shorthand for specifying complicated repetitions of 
the same operation on different sector sets. As the examples above demonstrate,  
using SCN_LOOPS can save a lot of typing, in particular if the number of cycles 
is large. <P>
	Note that each cycle of a loop starts the requested operation anew. To 
understand what this means, consider two ways to process all fields of a 
16-field mosaic observation: <P>
	SCN_LOOPS=&lt;no input&gt;                    SCN_LOOPS=16, ..1 
	SCN_SETS=grp.obs.*                      SCN_SETS=grp.obs.0 <P>
The left specification requests a single pass thorugh the operation using all 
fields as input. The right specification requests 16 passes successively using 
fields 0, 1, 2, ... as input.

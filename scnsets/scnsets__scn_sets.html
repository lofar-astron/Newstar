<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Sectors to process:  grp.obs.fld.chn.seq 
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(32), 64 values.<P>
 Quick reminders: =============== 

<DT>   - L gives you a quick summary of the groups in your .SCN file 

<DT>   - O gives you access to more detailed overviews in various levels of detail 

<DT>   - #&lt;n&gt; is a synonym for the grp.obs.fld.chn.seq index that is sometimes 
	convenient to use. # ('absolute') sector numbers are shown in most 
	displays that show sector indices. 

<DT>   - @ or &gt; will prompt you for each of the 5 indices separately. Use this 
	option if you are not yet comfortable with the sector-indexing system. 

<DT>   - If you have requested looping (SCN_LOOPS parameter), the sectors you 
	specify will be processed in the first loop cycle, and the indices 
	incremented for each following cycle. 

<DT>   - If you have second thoughts about looping, reply # or ctrl-D to backtrack. <P>
Sector selection: ================ 
	You may select SETS of sectors for processing by [ranges of] values for 
the five indices. A range has the form &lt;start&gt;-[&lt;end&gt;][:&lt;step&gt;]. A wildcard '*' 
means 'all'; *s and trailing dots may be omitted. 
   Example 
		. 3-7:2 . 4-:2 . 1-7 (blanks inserted for clarity only) 
   meaning 
	all grp (missing grp index is replaced by a '*') 
	for each grp: obs=3 to 7 in steps of 2 (i.e. 3, 5 and 7) 
	for each obs: all even fld starting at 4 
	for each fld: chn=1 to 7; 
	for each chn: all seq (omitted trailing seq index replaced by a '*') <P>
 
Multiple SETS may be specified, separated by comma's: &lt;Set1&gt;, &lt;Set2&gt;, ... The 
associated SCN_LOOPS keyword allows even more looping over index values. <P>
Other keywords allow the user to select hour-angle range, polarisation and 
interferometers within each SECTOR. <P>
Explanation of sector indices: ============================= 
	A .SCN file contains visibilities and associated data for one or more 
objects. The basic unit of data is the SECTOR, which is a collection of SCANS 
contiguous in hour angle for one sky position and one frequency. Sectors are 
addressed through a SECTOR INDEX which is a string of five integers separated 
by dots: 
			grp.obs.fld.chn.seq <P>
   The GROUP (grp) and OBSERVATION (obs) are basically administrative units for 
    organising the data, e.g. per object. grp and obs number alocations have 
    been determined by NSCAN when you read the data in. <P>
   Mosaic observations contain multiple FIELDs (fld), numbered from 0 to n-1 in 
    the sequence in which they were observed at the WSRT. A non-mosaic 
    observation contains only field 0. <P>
   Line and broadband continuum observations generally have several frequency 
    CHANNELS (chn), also known as 'bands'. The channles are numbered from 1 to 
    N. Channel 0 is by definition the 'continuum' channel, i.e. the sum of all 
    'line' channels. <P>
   In mosaic observations, the sector SEQUENCE (seq) number distinguishes the 
    successive hour-angle 'sectors'. Other situations are conceivable where 
    multiple sectors with the same grp.obs.fld.chn exist; it is then your 
    responsibility to know what they represent. <P>
Index values start at zero. (Remember that for the CHN index this is the 
continuum channel.) <P>

 Specify how you want to change the interferometer selection. <P>
Interferometers are defined as combinations of two telescopes; an 
interferometer may thus contain 1, 2 or 4 polarisations. <P>
A combination of two different telescopes is called a CROSS[-correlating] 
interferometer, a telescope combined with itself an AUTO[-correlating] 
interferometer. At present, WSRT data contain only cross-interferometer data,  
so selection/elimination of auto-interferometers is irrelevant. <P>
The following codes are used to identify (groups of) telescopes: <P>
	P       show the present selection table <P>
   For the WSRT: 
	0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D: 
		 individual WSRT telescopes (case-insensitive) 
	*       all telescopes or all cross interferometers 
	F       all fixed telescopes = 0 through 9 
	M       all movable telescopes = A through D 
	Y       telescopes A and B 
	Z       telescopes C and D 
	#       autocorrelation <P>
   Additional codes for the Australian Telecope Compact Array (ATCA): 
	T       ATCA telescopes (8-D) 
	U       the ATCA complement (0-7). <P>
An interferometer specification without a prefix or prefixed with a + sign is 
SELECTED, a specification with a minus sign prefixed is ELIMINATED. Selection 
and elimination are incremental. Up to 40 select/eliminate specifications may 
be given, separated by comma's; they will be honored in the order in which you 
give them. Prompting will continue until you stop replying. <P>
The standard operation is on the cross-correlations. A telescope name followed 
with a # indicates the auto-correlations. <P>
Examples: 

<DT>	-3F     eliminate combinations of 3 with other fixed telescopes 
	FM, -9A  select all fixed-movable combinations (the WSRT's 40 'standard' 
		 interferometers) except 9A 

<DT>	-#, 33   eliminate all auto-interferometers, then re-select 33

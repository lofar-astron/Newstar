\caption[]{\it
\label{.mosaic.sectors}
Sectors in the {\rm uv} plane.
\\
Left: For a standard observation the scans for a single observation and channel
are contiguous and can be lumped together in a single sector. \\
Right: In a mosaic observation the cuts for a given field are interleaved with
cuts for other fields, so each cut is stored in a sector of its own.
\\
The sector numbers shown are just by way of example.

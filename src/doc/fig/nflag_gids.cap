The use of a flag file to transfer flagging commands into NFLAG.
\\
Flag files contain flagging commands that NFLAG can read and execute. Both a
compact binary form (the .FLF file) and a bulky text form are available. The
latter form can be edited manually.
\\
Flag files may be generated by \whichref{NGIDS}{} and through commands in the
\whichref{FLIST}{} branch of NFLAG.

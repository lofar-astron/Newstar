psctest.csh
===========

	Options to:

	- Create a .pst file by running program under manual control.

	- Create reference numbers on the parameter lines.

	- Run program under control of a .pst file:
	  = Including backtrack paths
	  = Including on-line help requests at first appearance of each
	    parameter.
	  = Using only a certain range of parameter lines
	  = In /ASK mode including hidden parameters



.pst file
=========

	Consists of:

	- Preamble: a csh script, ending in the line 'exit'. This script is
executed by psctest.csh to set up initial conditions (i.e. verify accessibility
of input files, remove left-over output files etc.).

	- Parameter input: Lines of the form

		<blanks>[*]<blanks><KEYWORD> = <value> ! <number>

The lines are indented corresponding to the 'level' of the parameter in its
local context. The asterix is positioned at the level of a preceding parameter
that is the target for a backtrack request.

	- Comment lines starting in a '!'.


	The simplest way to generate an initial .pst file is through

		psctest -m <program>

The file may then be manually edited to e.g.

	- insert the initialising script;

	- remove spurious parts (e.g. backtracks accidentally made in the manual
	   run);

	- change improper backtrack targets to what they should be (Of course,
	   corresponding changes must be made in the program code!).

After a change in the parameter lines, they may be renumbered through

		psctest -n.


Special cases
=============

Unconditional backtracking
--------------------------

	To be realised by listing the parameters through which the backtrack is
made with '#' input, at the proper indentation (i.e. indents for a backtrack
chain decrease downward). Do not include '*' backtrack marks!


Repetition loop
---------------

	Occurs e.g. in NSCAN LOAD, NMAP MAKE. Append indices in [] to the
parameter name to show the cycle number. Continue increasing indentation
throughout the loop.


Hidden parameters
-----------------

	To be indented at the same level as the subsequent visible parameter.

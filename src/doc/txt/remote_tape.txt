Transparent reading of the Optical Disks with Newstar
-----------------------------------------------------

It is now possible to access the optical disk units that are 
connected to the VAX while working on a Unix machine.

In Dwingeloo, the following tape-devices have been defined:

   MAG4   //rzmvx4.nfra.nl:1100/RZMVX4$MUA0  
   MAG5   //rzmvx4.nfra.nl:1101/RZMVX4$MUA1

These devives allow you to read data from the units MUA0 and MUA1
as if they were connected to your Unix machine.

If you work on e.g. rzmws10 and you want to get data from MUA0,
just run NSCAN and specify unit 4. 


Note 1: Implementation
 
   Transparent reading is implemented by a server on the VAX and
   an extension of the tape-handling routines in Newstar.
   The server on the VAX is USER5:[DEVOSCM.RMTD]RMTD.EXE
   The server has to be started on two ports, this can be done
   by including in the system-startup:

      @user5:[devoscm.rmtd]rmtd_start.com  
  
   which will submit two jobs on RZMVX4_BATCH.

   The names of the remote units have been defined in the startup file
       $n_src/sys/newstar_nfra.csh

   The routines changed for the implementation are $n_src/wng/wnftrw.cun 
   and $n_src/wng/wnf???_x.cun. The code for the client side of the 
   network is in wnftrw.cun. The changes in the other files are: (1) all
   calls to open, close, read and write now go through a routine in 
   wnftrw.cun and (2) all calls to routines wnftrw pass the MCA (not FCA)

Note 2: Suggested testing

   To test the reliability of the transparent tape-reading I suggest
   the following. During the next week, all files read from Optical Disk
   by the Reduction Group are read two times and then compared

      1e. Unix: NSCAN LOAD UNIT=4 or 5 

      2e. VAX:  NSCAN LOAD UNIT=4 or 5
          Unix: ftp SCN-file
                NSCAN CVX

      3e. Unix: ~devoscm/tst.csh File1.SCN File2.SCN
  
   If the files have been loaded identically, no differences should appear.
   The tst.csh procedure ignores differences of 1 unit in the data, since 
   they can be produced by rounding errors during the time-averaging.

   Any differences should be reported to Marco de Vos.

   After testing some 10 SCN files, we are sure that no systematic errors 
   take place. The remaining test is on reliability of the connection over
   a longer period. This can be tested by using only the Unix version of 
   Newstar to read data from the archive. After a month, we will have a 
   good impression of the reliability.

	The OH (Observation Header) of an observation file on a WSRT tape is
copied literally into a OHW block asspociated with one or more Sectors in a
.SCN file. It contains several fields describing the natiure of the
observation. The meaning of the ASCII that may occur in these fields is
tabulated below.

 SPEFU=   Meaning
 ------   -------
  PT     Pointing observation
  HO     Holog observation
  OF     Offset observation
  VL     VLBI observation
  MO     Mosaiking observation
  PD     Pulsar observation (DCB)
  DF     Delay offset observation (DCB)
  LO     LO sweep observation
  FS     FS frequency switching observation
  SD     Switched dipole observation
  NO     No special observation

Trapping control-C in Newstar programs -------------------------------------- 

        (contributed by JPH 941005, gleaned from wndpar_x.fun, wngex.for) 




        INCLUDE WXH_DEF ... 
        XHCC(0)=1                       ! inhibit ... 
        XHCC(0)=0                       ! clear 
        IF (XHCC(1) .NE.0) THEN         ! was a control-C caught? 
          XHCC(1)=0 
          <action, typically CALL WNGEX> 
        ENDIF 

        This code has been used to create module WNGCC with entry points 

                WNGCCD          disable control-C 
                WNGCCE          enable control-C 
                LOGICAL WNGCCC  check and reset 'control-c seen' status

and several other entry points to check, count and reset the number of
interrupts seen. 


        The implementation is in entry point WNGEX0 in wngex.for. This routine
is declared the handler for signal SIGINT by wngsxh.fsc. Its action is very
simple: 

        if xhcc(0) !=0 
                xhcc(1)+=1 
        else 
                fall through to WNGEX 

        endif

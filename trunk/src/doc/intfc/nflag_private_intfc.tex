\tableofcontents


\section{ Overview}

	This document contains an overview of the parameter interface of the
program NFLAG. The program also uses a number of public interfaces; references
to these are also \textref{listed}{.public}.

%       \Figref{.nflag.interface} and its companion \figref{.nflag.extract}
% show schematically the various branches of program execution and the
% parameters that the user must provide to control each of them.

%\input {../fig/nflag_interface.cap}

	The remainder of the document describes the individual parameters in
alphabetical order. This description centers on the Help texts, which have been
designed to guide the user to the proper choice at each junction, even if his
knowledge of the overall workings of the program is only superficial.

\section{ Overview}
\label{.overview}

        This document contains an overview of the public parameter group
NMAP.This group is a subset of the map-making control parameters, viz.
thoseparameters that are also used by NCLEAN in its
\textref{"dataclean"}{nclean_descr.data.clean} operation.

        The accompanying diagrams are to be found in the document
describingNMAP's \textref{private parameters}{nmap_private_intfc}. This
document contiansonly the descriptions of the individual parameters in
alphabetical order. Thesecenter on the Help texts, which have been designed to
guide the user to theproper choice at each junction, even if his knowledge of
the overall workingsof the program is only superficial.

        The prompt and help texts defined for these parameters are those
for NMAP. In the data-clean application, these may be overridden by texts more
appropriate there. Unfortunately, the present architecture of
\NEWSTAR precludes the inclusion of such texts in the documentation system,
so the only opportunity to read that information is during program execution
(in your terminal window!).

\input {nmap_make_q.cap}

        \Figref{.nmap.make.q} gives a schematic overview of this part of
NMAP'sparameter interface. (The companion diagram to which the figure refers is
irrelevant in the present context, but you may find it in the description of
NMAP's  \textref{private interface}{nmap_private_intfc.nmap.make}.)

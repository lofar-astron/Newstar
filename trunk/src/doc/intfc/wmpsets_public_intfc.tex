\chapter{ Public parameter group WMPSETS}
\tableofcontents


\section{ Overview}

	This document contains an overview of the public parameter group
WMPSETS, (part of) which is included in several \NEWSTAR programs.

%       \Figref{.wmpsets.interface} and its companion \figref{.wmpsets.extract}
%show schematically the various branches of program execution and the
%parameters that the user must provide to control each of them.

%\input {../fig/wmpsets_interface.cap}

	The
%remainder of the
document describes the individual parameters in alphabetical order. This
description centers on the Help texts, which have been designed to guide the
user to the proper choice at each junction, even if his knowledge of the
overall workings of the program is only superficial.

	Please note that the generic prompt and help texts defined for these
parameters are frequently superseded in the actual applications by alternative
texts that are more appropriate to the situation at hand. Unfortunately, the
present architecture of \NEWSTAR precludes the inclusion of such texts in the
documentation system, so the only opportunity to read that information is
during program execution (in your terminal window!).

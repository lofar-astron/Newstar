A collection of obscure Newstar bugs and their antidotes
--------------------------------------------------------

	Like any system its size, Newstar is sensitive to programming errors
that are eaily made. Some of these may result in very obscure behaviour that
may be difficult to diagnose. This document is meant to formalise our
collective knowledge in this area. Anyone who solves a problem of this type is
invited to record his experience here so others after him may benefit from it.


Symptom: When exiting, the program emits a series of messages
-------
	mv: <file name> is identical to <filename>

Cause: The first argument in a WNCTXT call should be a bitmask (normally F_T or
F_TP). Omitting it or putting something else in its place may cause this type
of behaviour.

Symptom: Program crashes with IOT 6 (?)
-------
Cause: Division by 0 (and probably other arithmetic exceptions)

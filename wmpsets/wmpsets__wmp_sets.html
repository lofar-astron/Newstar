<DT><EM>Prompt:</EM> Images to process:  grp.fld.chn.pol.typ.seq |
<DT><EM>Expected input:</EM> Character(32), 64 values.<P>
	A NEWSTAR .WMP file contains maps and antenna patterns for one or more 
objects. The basic unit of data is the two-dimensional IMAGE representing 
either a MAP of a piece of sky or the synthesised ANTENNA PATTERN. Images are 
addressed through an IMAGE INDEX which is a string of six integers separated by 
dots: <P>
			grp.fld.chn.pol.typ.seq <P>
   A GROUP is basically an administrative unit, allowing the user to subdivide 
    his data, e.g. per object. <P>
   The FIELD and CHANNEL are the field and channel numbers of the observation(s) 
    in the .SCN file from which the image was made. These numbers are defined by 
    the way the observation was made and should be indentical for 
    all observations involved (which could, e.g., be several 12-hour mosaic 
    observations with different baseline sets.). <P>
   POL is a code indicating the polarisation. The code distinguishes the 
    four components of a full polarisation represntation: <P>
		0, 1, 2, 3 =  XX.XY.YX.YY or 
		0, 1, 2, 3 =  I, Q, U, V <P>
    but it is your responsibility to remember which of the two representations 
    applies. <P>
   TYP codes the type of image: 0 for a map, 1 for an antenna pattern. <P>
   The image SEQ uence number distinguishes images for which all five of 
    the preceding indices are identical. It is used in particular to distinguish 
    residual maps in a CLEAN sequence. It is your responsibility to know what 
    the different SEQ values represent. <P>
Index values start at zero. (Remember that for the CHN index 0 is the continuum 
channel.) <P>
You may select SETS of images for processing through [ranges of] values for the 
five indices, e.g. <P>
		2.3-5:2.*.1-7.* <P>
The WILDCARD value '*' means 'all'. Each index may also be specified as a 
RANGE: &lt;first&gt;-&lt;last&gt;[&lt;:increment&gt;]. Indices omitted are assumed to be '*',  
i.e.  ....1.0  means *.*.*.*.1.0. For wildcards at the end the dots may also be 
omitted, i.e. 1.0 means 1.0.*.*.*.* <P>
The notation 3-5:2 stands for 'from 3 through 5 in steps of 2'. The step must 
be positive; if it is omitted, it is taken to be 1 (as in '1-7' above). <P>
Multiple image SETS may be specified, separated by comma's: &lt;Set1&gt;, &lt;Set2&gt;, ... 
The associated WMP_LOOPS keyword allows even more looping over index values. <P>
IF YOU WANT TO BE REMINDED OF WHAT IMAGES ARE IN YOUR FILE: 
	Type O or L in response to this prompt to get an Overview or Layout 
	of your .WMP file. <P>
IF YOU DO NOT YET FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THESE CONCEPTS MORE HELP IS PROVIDED: 
	Type '@' or '&gt;' to be prompted for each of the 6 indices separately,  
	with more specific explanation per index. <P>
IF YOU GET BORED WITH 6-NUMBER INDICES: 
	Absolute Cut nrs '#&lt;n&gt;' can be used as an alternative. <P>
